  abstract = {We investigate the formation of minimum income aspirations in South Africa, a country characterised by high poverty rates and high and rising rates of inequality. Although a few empirical studies have explored income aspirations in South Africa, this is the first study that analyses nationally representative micro-data. We add to the broader empirical literature on income aspirations in two ways. First, we investigate whether there is evidence of aspirations failure among the poor and we test the relationship between aspirations and income inequality. Second, we explore whether aspirations have different associations when social comparisons are drawn with different reference groups. Our analysis of the minimum income question (MIQ) asked in a national household survey from 2008/2009 shows that although aspirations increase significantly with income, the poor are far more likely than the non-poor to report aspirations that exceed current income. The aspirations of both the poor and the non-poor also vary positively (and not negatively) with local levels of inequality, although aspirations respond significantly only to the relative success of others in the same race group.},

  abstract = {This paper uses panel data on urban Ethiopian households (1994–2009) to compare trends in “subjective poverty” (self‐perceived deprivation) with standard money‐metric poverty rates, showing that while objective poverty falls steadily, subjective poverty remains constant. It relies on a direct survey question about deprivation rather than a minimum‐income‐needed question (MIQ) or any regression‐based approach to derive a household‐level money‐metric subjective poverty line, and it does not estimate an explicit SPL or compare it numerically to an official poverty threshold.},

  title = {Determinants of Poverty in Malawi: Evidence from the Fifth Integrated Household Survey 2019},
  journal = {Korean Agricultural Economics Association},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {This study uses the 2019 Malawi Fifth Integrated Household Survey with 2,688 data to determine poverty factors in Malawi. Households’ subjective assessment of poverty having six levels is used with an ordered-probit model since it can easily catch deprivation in various aspects of people’s lives and complement the income-based poverty measurement for farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, consumption poverty using the annual per capita consumption value is compared with subjective poverty with a multinomial logit model. A partial proportional odds model is used as it rejects the parallel lines assumption. The overall results indicate that subjective and consumption poverty determinants overlap. But subjective poverty is more associated with household assets, natural disasters, aid, financial inclusion, food security, marital status, and education level than consumption poverty in Malawi. Policy support for continuing and developing subsidy programs for food, agricultural input, and life convenience is suggested since ongoing programs equally treat a variety of households and increase possibilities to escape both subjective and consumption poverty. Also, a rural extension program that provides asset management education is expected to draw overall welfare for vulnerable households. Finally, female welfare should be improved by reducing the wage gap and diversifying its welfare programs to improve the social perception of female labor.},

  abstract = {We use data from 11\,280 households included in the Malawi Integrated Household Survey 2004/5. We compare the wealth index with four subjective measures of SEP: perceived food consumption adequacy, perceived overall consumption adequacy, an economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency. The wealth index is compared with each subjective SEP measure in terms of: (i) agreement of classification of households, (ii) targeting accuracy with respect to US$1-a-day poverty based on consumption expenditure, and (iii) the socio-economic processes (household- and community-level) giving rise to the SEP scores. Each subjective SEP indicator resulted in considerable differential classification of households compared with the wealth index. Three measures of subjective SEP (perceived food consumption adequacy, economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency) identified a higher proportion of dollar-a-day poor households as poor than the wealth index.},

  journal = {Social Indicators Research},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {This paper uses a 2016 nationally representative rural‐China survey (n = 2,025 households) and applies a straightforward Minimum Income Question (MIQ)—“Please offer an income amount below which you will feel poor for a household as yours”—to estimate each household’s per‐capita subjective poverty line by dividing the self‐reported minimum by household size. The authors report a mean subjective poverty threshold of 8,297 yuan per capita (vs. the 2,800 yuan official national line), classify households as subjectively poor when actual per‐capita income falls below their self‐stated need, compute a “depth of subjective poverty” gap, and contrast subjective poverty status with objective (national line) status. Although methodologically aligned with MIQ‐based SPL estimation, the study is set entirely in rural China and does not employ regression (e.g., Leyden‐type or quantile) nor focus on multivariate or panel analyses.},

  journal = {Applied Economics Letters},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {In this paper, we focus on poor households vs. non-poor households, using objective and subjective definitions of poverty. We evaluate the various responses of these households to changes in food expenditures, income, and prices, and simulate the welfare losses of food price changes across poverty definitions. We use the QUAIDS model to estimate food elasticities and rely on the National Survey of Expenditure and Household Income, from Uruguay 2016/2017, because it contains novel information on the subjective poverty status of each household. Our results show important differences across poverty definitions. In addition, we find that price increases may lead to larger welfare losses in poor households. On average, the percentage of income needed to avoid a loss in the economic welfare of poor households, defined by the objective method, is twice that required by the non-poor households, for all price changes. Differences are much smaller when using the subjective approach. Our main contribution is the first evidence of consumption behaviour and welfare analysis under different poverty measures. Our findings highlight the need for policies that mitigate the negative effects of price shocks.},

  note = {This 2013 study proposes and tests a vignette‐anchored measure of subjective poverty—asking respondents to compare their own welfare to that of a “poor” household described in a vignette—to correct for scale heterogeneity in self‐assessed welfare. Using specially designed surveys in Tajikistan, Guatemala, and Tanzania (not Africa/South Africa), the authors show how vignette corrections alter subjective poverty rates and compare probit regressions with and without these corrections. The paper does not use minimum‐income/expenditure questions (e.g. MIQ, Leyden line), does not convert responses into a money‐metric household poverty threshold, and contains no comparison to objective poverty lines; it focuses solely on scale heterogeneity in ordinal welfare assessments.}
