  abstract = {China is undergoing a campaign which is called “The Targeted Poverty Alleviation Policy” to eradicate extreme poverty from rural China until 2020. Though poverty in rural China has been studied intensively in different objective dimensions, little attention has been paid to poverty line settings and subjective poverty, which are hinged to the policy effects. In order to fill in the research gap, this study employs a nationally representative survey of rural households in 2016, to measure subjective poverty in rural China, and analyze the determinants as well. Our results indicate that the mean subjective poverty line of the rural households is 8297 yuan per capita, which is far higher than the national poverty line (2800 yuan). Statistically, 29\% of the surveyed rural households who are not objectively poor feel subjectively poor. The objective poverty line cannot fully reflect the subjective poverty perception. Thus, how to reduce the subjective poverty perception could be a major policy agenda in rural China after 2020, when extreme poverty is no longer a problem.}

  abstract = {PurposeDespite rising incomes and reduction of extreme poverty, the feeling of being poor remains widespread. Support programs can improve well-being, but they first require identifying who are the households that judge their income is insufficient to meet their basic needs, and what factors are associated with subjective poverty.Design/methodology/approachHouseholds report the income level they judge is sufficient to make ends meet. Then, they are classified as being subjectively poor if their own monetary income is inferior to the level they indicated. Second, the study compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms, the random forest, support vector machines and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, applied to a set of socioeconomic variables to predict subjective poverty status.FindingsThe random forest generates 85.29\% of correct predictions using a range of income and non-income predictors, closely followed by the other two techniques. For the middle-income group, the LASSO regression outperforms random forest. Subjective poverty is mostly associated with monetary income for low-income households. However, a combination of low income, low endowment (land, consumption assets) and unusual large expenditure (medical, gifts) constitutes the key predictors of feeling poor for the middle-income households.Practical implicationsTo reduce the feeling of poverty, policy intervention should continue to focus on increasing incomes. However, improvements in nonincome domains such as health expenditure, education and family demographics can also relieve the feeling of income inadequacy. Methodologically, better performance of either algorithm depends on the data at hand.Originality/valueFor the first time, the authors show that prediction techniques are reliable to identify subjective poverty prevalence, with example from rural China. The analysis offers specific attention to the modest-income households, who may feel poor but not be identified as such by objective poverty lines, and is relevant when policy-makers seek to address the “next step” after ending extreme poverty. Prediction performance and mechanisms for three machine learning algorithms are compared.}

This paper studies the merit of this approach by using survey data of public opinion collected in Hong Kong in 2023. To derive the CSPL, the classic method relies on a log function relating the subjectively perceived income need to actual income to derive the subjective poverty line. We found the CSPL thus derived grossly overstates the poverty rate compared to conventional approaches (e.g., based on relative income). Two alternative consensual-building methods based on weighted averaging and machine learning are considered; while they show some differences, they do not address the basic problem. While the CSPL may not accurately reflect the degree of poverty, the data can be used to identify factors influencing public perceptions of income needs. We demonstrate how this can be done through a preliminary analysis.}

Our estimations are based on a Minimum Income Question using data from a representative survey, EU-SILC. We find robust empirical evidence of decreasing trends in subjective poverty in 16 of 28 EU countries. We conjecture that trends in subjective poverty may reflect changes in societies which are not captured by official poverty indicators, and our results thus enrich the existing data on general poverty trends in the EU.}

  abstract = {Conventional (income-based) poverty measures have been criticised for being narrowly focused and failing to provide evidence that those identified as poor have an unacceptable standard of living. The consensual approach to deprivation addresses both weaknesses by drawing on community perceptions of what items are essential for all and establishing that those who do not have them cannot afford them. In contrast, the consensual income approach maintains the role of income as a key determinant of poverty but uses community perceptions of how much is needed to make ends meet to set a poverty line. Although perceptions vary widely, it is possible to estimate the income level at which people with that income would say that their current income is just enough to make ends meet. This article re-examines this approach drawing on recent developments in poverty research and using new data for Australia. The consensual poverty lines produced are shown to have similarities with those used in existing poverty studies, but also to exhibit important differences. An overlap measure is developed that includes those in consensual poverty who also indicate that their current income is not enough for them to make ends meet. The poverty rates produced by this overlap measure is shown to align with those based on the 50 per cent of median-income OECD equivalised poverty line used in most Australian studies. It is argued that the consensual income approach has the potential to advance our understanding of poverty beyond that provided by conventional income-based measures.}

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Poverty, despite being a multifaceted concept, is commonly measured in either absolute or relative monetary terms. However, it can also be measured subjectively, as people form perceptions on their relative income, welfare, and life satisfaction. Poverty measurement based on objective indicators such as official poverty lines is often used to orient and prioritize policy actions. However, such ‘standard’ poverty measures based on household consumption or income aggregates have several shortcomings. This objective indicator does little to inform policy makers about public preferences. The main goal of this paper is to investigate multifaceted poverty measurement by combining objective and subjective measures to provide useful insights into poverty in Malaysia. In addition, this study explored the multifaceted poverty incidence among the low-income household from the perspective of zakat applicants.     Methodology: Data was collected using a survey and interviews of zakat applicants under the category of poor and needy in the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRC) of Melaka, one of the states in Malaysia. Three poverty measurements, i.e., Poverty Line Income (PLI), Haddul Kifayah and Subjective Poverty Index (SPI), are utilized in this study.  Findings: The PLI and Haddul Kifayah are categorized as objective poverty measures, while SPI is categorized as a subjective poverty measure. The different measures of poverty would produce different analytical results that, in turn, call for a different set of policy interventions.     Contributions: These findings point to the needs of tailor-made strategies for the society to cope with multifaceted poverty.     Keywords: Multifaceted poverty, objective poverty, subjective poverty, poverty measurement, zakat recipients.     Cite as: Othman, A., Mohd Noor, A.

We use longitudinal EU-SILC data for 2005–2012 following the approach of Goedhart et al. (1977) as employed by Bishop et al. (2014). The use of longitudinal data shows that previous results on the subjective minimum income that were based on the OLS estimates for cross-section data overestimated the impact from current income and underestimated the role of economies of scale. Subjective equivalence scales imply a decreasing marginal cost of children in the three countries, which makes them distinct from the OECD scale. The marginal cost of a first child is similar to the values assumed in the OECD scale, but the cost of a second child is much lower.}

However, current developments indicate that there are other aspects that are equally important in addressing the issues of poverty. Thus, accurate diagnosis of the causes of poverty and the identification of the poor and the needy is crucial in ensuring proper assistance is extended to those who are in need. There are two main approaches in identifying poverty namely objective and subjective poverty. Objective poverty is based on income while subjective poverty utilised a participatory approach in determining poverty status. This study further includes zakat (tithe) based poverty associated with zakat institutions, as it is the focus of this study. Zakat based poverty or had-al-kifayah considers expenditure of household in determining the minimum amount requires by household. Zakat institutions are organisations entrusted to collect and distribute zakat to the beneficiaries; utilised zakat-based poverty line to screen applicants for zakat fund distribution. Zakat based poverty line income is a variant of objective poverty. However, the multifaced nature of poverty should include subjective poverty approach for a more accurate identification of the poor and the needy. As such, the paper evaluates the three poverty approaches as discussed. Data were obtained from a survey of the applicants of zakat fund in the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRC) of Melaka, one of the states in Malaysia. Our findings revealed that there are significant differences between each approach in determining who the poor are. Poverty Line Income and zakat-based poverty reported a lower number of poor and needy compare to subjective poverty estimates. Subjective poverty approach if utilised will complement current approaches and enhance the identification of the poor and need.}

  abstract = {This study uses the 2019 Malawi Fifth Integrated Household Survey with 2,688 data to determine poverty factors in Malawi. Households’ subjective assessment of poverty having six levels is used with an ordered-probit model since it can easily catch deprivation in various aspects of people’s lives and complement the income-based poverty measurement for farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, consumption poverty using the annual per capita consumption value is compared with subjective poverty with a multinomial logit model. A partial proportional odds model is used as it rejects the parallel lines assumption. The overall results indicate that subjective and consumption poverty determinants overlap. But subjective poverty is more associated with household assets, natural disasters, aid, financial inclusion, food security, marital status, and education level than consumption poverty in Malawi. Policy support for continuing and developing subsidy programs for food, agricultural input, and life convenience is suggested since ongoing programs equally treat a variety of households and increase possibilities to escape both subjective and consumption poverty. Also, a rural extension program that provides asset management education is expected to draw overall welfare for vulnerable households. Finally, female welfare should be improved by reducing the wage gap and diversifying its welfare programs to improve the social perception of female labor.}

The findings provide an argument for increasing the official poverty line for China as average household income increases. Poverty in rural China is disproportionally concentrated to the western regions and to poor counties. Most of rural China’s poverty can be attributed to households living outside classified poor areas.

What’s more, public services supply, physical capital, financial capital, and human capital affect the subjective poverty of urban and rural residents at different significance levels.

  abstract = {Abstract We analyse the subjective perceptions of poverty in Madagascar in 2001 and their relationship to objective poverty indicators. We base our analysis on survey responses to a series of subjective perception questions. We extend the existing empirical methodology for estimating subjective poverty lines on the basis of categorical consumption adequacy questions. Based on this methodology, we calculate the household-specific, subjective poverty lines. We are able to compare between the results of subjective poverty analysis using several types of subjective welfare questions. Our results show that the aggregate poverty measures derived from consumption adequacy questions accord quite well with the poverty measures based on objective poverty lines. We demonstrate that the subjective welfare analysis can be used in poor developing countries for evaluating socio-economic and distributional impacts of various policy interventions.}

  abstract = {Using European Social Survey data, this article studies the prevalence of objective and subjective poverty among older women and men (60+ years) in 21 European countries. Objective poverty refers to whether one’s disposable income falls below the poverty line, whereas subjective poverty relates to the capacity to make ends meet. It analyzes gender differences in these two dimensions of poverty and the role of gender as an explanation to these phenomena while controlling for other individual-level variables as well as the role of welfare state regimes. The results show that older women are more exposed to objective poverty than men, and that female gender remains strongly and positively correlated with this kind of poverty even when controlling for other variables. They also show that other individual-level variables, such as partnership, paid work and education curbs objective poverty, while the type of welfare regime does not matter. As to subjective poverty, on the other hand, there is no significant association with female gender, nor with the type of welfare regime, while individual-level variables such as subjective health, partnership and paid work are negatively correlated with this dimension of poverty. Subjective poverty is somewhat more influenced by contextual factors than objective poverty although the type of welfare state regime is not significantly associated with subjective or objective poverty.}

The study is the first estimate of a wellbeing function for Bangladesh using nationally representative micro-panel data. Employing a linear panel model with individual random effects and a large set of control variables like education, work status and disability, we found a strong and positive relationship between wellbeing and income. Being further below the poverty line—estimated using the depth-of-poverty measure—was found to have a significant negative effect on happiness. On the other hand, the income of the reference group was found to be just as important as one’s own income for an individual’s happiness. Comparisons were found to be asymmetric and upwards. Improvements in a multidimensional poverty index, constructed using indicators of household education, health and living standards, were found to have a positive and significant relationship with happiness in all specifications. Gender-disaggregated analysis reveals that, while the income effect was found to be stronger for male individuals, the effects of relative income, monetary and non-monetary poverty on subjective wellbeing are larger for female individuals. The results thus point towards a need to incorporate such notions into the assessment of individuals’ wellbeing.}

  abstract = {Poverty has always been a highly visible problem not restricted to the poorest countries as often is believed. It is a phenomenon occurring all over the world, with varying degrees of intensity. The state of poverty is not dichotomous and cannot be simplified down to categorizations of “poor” and “not poor.” There are many degrees of poverty ranging from none to extreme. Research on poverty, which has been going on for more than 120 years, rarely acknowledges this reality. Moreover, the measurement of poverty is often limited to objective measures that describe economic conditions, e.g. by household income or expenditure. However, the problem of subjective poverty measurement is important, as it studies the different perceptions of poverty among respondents and is often dependent on the point of reference (on the groups to which the respondents compare themselves such as neighbors or family). Hence, we undertook research on the measurement of subjective poverty. We proposed and compared four approaches to the construction of a synthetic index of subjective poverty using the classic and fuzzy TOPSIS (The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and the classic and fuzzy Hellwig's method. The vertex method (fuzzy approaches) and generalized distance measure (classic approaches) were used to calculate the distance from the pattern and the anti-pattern. The main goal is presenting approaches to assessing subjective poverty of households and comparing the results obtained with their help. The research was based on the primary research entitled “My situation during the coronavirus pandemic” conducted in April 2021. The measurement of the level of subjective poverty is an important tool for assessing anti-poverty policy; furthermore, the proposed methods for quantification of subjective poverty can be the basis for the development of anti-poverty strategies and policies}

This study employed data from the Malawi 2010 Demographic and Health Survey to examine the relative ranking of women ( 23,020) across the wealth index scale by identifying the characteristics of women which influence their likelihood of belonging to “poor” or “rich” households. Results from the ordered probit model show that older women and those with some formal schooling were likely to fall within the higher categories of the wealth status index. Belonging to households headed by females was associated with lower categories of wealth status than those headed by males. We interpret these results in line with the current development strategies aimed at reducing poverty and hunger by 2015 and the need to identify and respond appropriately to the layers of socioeconomic vulnerability in Malawi.}

We evaluate the various responses of these households to changes in food expenditures, income, and prices, and simulate the welfare losses of food price changes across poverty definitions. We use the QUAIDS model to estimate food elasticities and rely on the National Survey of Expenditure and Household Income, from Uruguay 2016/2017, because it contains novel information on the subjective poverty status of each household. Our results show important differences across poverty definitions. In addition, we find that price increases may lead to larger welfare losses in poor households. On average, the percentage of income needed to avoid a loss in the economic welfare of poor households, defined by the objective method, is twice that required by the non-poor households, for all price changes. Differences are much smaller when using the subjective approach. Our main contribution is the first evidence of consumption behaviour and welfare analysis under different poverty measures. Our findings highlight the need for policies that mitigate the negative effects of price shocks.}

We use 2015-2018 French data to determine the share of the population who considers itself as poor and study its social composition. Our results demonstrate that class, family composition and income instability matter as determinants of subjective poverty. The key feature of the group of those who consider themselves as poor is a degraded attitude towards their own future.

OECD uses the OECD scale while Eurostat uses the OECD-modified equivalence scale. It allows the international comparison of income and consumption level of households across all states. However, this commonly used scales may not be suitable for all countries, because they do not reflect any country specific economic conditions. Economies of scales are highly dependent on the structure of household consumption and expenditures which varies significantly across countries. Therefore, the need of national equivalence scales appropriate for each country is observed.The aim of this contribution is to compare the international scales with the equivalence scales estimated within our research. These scales are suitable for the Czech Republic as they take into account the economies of scale realized by Czech households. Two alternative approaches have been applied: an expenditure equation and utility function. The first one uses household budget survey data (HBS), the second approach is based on survey on income and living conditions (SILC). It has been proved that estimated equivalence scales differ to international ones. Subsequently, the impact in income and poverty indicators has been assessed. Overall effect on poverty indicators is not big, however a significant impact on specific group of people is observed. Mainly influenced groups are children and pensioners.The national scales affect the countries differently, especially in comparison of specific groups of by their social status. The second approach allows also international comparison as SILC is harmonized in Europe. The different impact of equivalence scales across European states is provided.}

The paper also aims to find out how poverty lines and poverty counts derived from people's perception relate to what has been previously reported. Design/methodology/approach - The Subjective Poverty Line (SPL) methodology is modified by asking one question on the amount of grains necessary for the respondent's household and another on the amount of cash necessary. Information was obtained from a large survey covering 22 provinces in 2003 and analysed using regressions analysis. Findings - People in high-income counties perceive that more cash, but not grains are needed than those living in low-income counties. Respondents perceive that economies of scale exist in amounts of cash needed for a household. They also perceive that young children need less grain than adults and that a schoolchild incurs higher money expenditures than an adult. A poverty line for rural China derived by the SPL methodology is higher than the low income line used by the National Bureau of Statistics for 2002. However, a poverty count based on the SPL methodology is similar to what has been reported. Practical implications - The findings suggest that poverty lines for rural China preferably should consider not only spatial differences in cost of living but also the number of household members in a non-linear way. Originality/value - The paper describes the first application of the SPL approach to rural China.}

  abstract = {The notion of ‘poverty’ is diversified and dynamic. It varies across countries with different socio-economic norms. It may also change over time even in the same society, with different stages of social and economic development. A country may be struggling with absolute poverty at the early stages of development, while it may well be more concerned with relative and/or subjective poverty as its average per-capita income increases. This article intends to conduct an exploration of multiple poverty measures by looking into the absolute, relative and subjective poverty incidence in Indonesia. Using the 2005 National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas), we observed that there was a roughly 28 percentage-point difference in the poverty headcount ratios computed by applying absolute (14.47\%) and subjective (42.03\%) poverty. There were virtually no correlations among the poverty rankings in the provinces of Indonesia obtained by five poverty metrics. Results of logit model and ordered logit model estimations of the possible determinants of poverty indicate that the main determinants of poverty are educational attainment, number of household members, physical assets (land and house ownership), existence of migrant workers (possible remittances), negative shocks of layoffs and/or health problems, development of public services, and the availability of road infrastructure. A higher educational attainment increases the probability of never being poor in any of the five poverty metrics by almost 11 percentage points. This study also confirmed that households having less than society’s averages in terms of the physical asset of land and consumption of durable goods and fashion tended to subjectively asses themselves as poor. The study suggests that any poverty alleviation programs should consider relative impacts among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries within each locality and across provinces.}

The poor have their own understanding and interpretation of their socio-economic situation. Poverty could be analyzed in a more comprehensive and better dimension by combining objective and subjective measures in identifying the poor. The Millennium Development Goals Report (MDGR, 2015) designates that Malaysia has been successful eliminated objective poverty. Despite that, the issue of poverty still surfing especially the zakat authorities are experiencing increasing in the zakat applications categorized poor and needy each day. To avoid the situation where individuals are wrongly defined as poor or non-poor are to compile objective and subjective measures on poverty. The objectives of the study are to determine the criteria of subjective poor and to propose subjective poverty index (SPI) as an alternative poverty measurement. The empirical analysis was based of 507 zakat applicants of poor and needy in Melaka. The data was analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods in four phases of analysis.  The findings confirmed that subjective poverty index (SPI) is an initial effort to explain poverty in the perspective of the poor.}

Two approaches can be used to estimate these scales: an “objective” approach based on modelling household consumption expenditure, or a ``subjective” approach based on how households perceive their standard of living. This article focuses on the latter. Using data from the 1995 to 2011 editions of the French Household Expenditure survey (Budget de famille) by Insee, estimations of equivalence scales highlight the sensitivity of results to the model specification, estimation coverage, the choice of subjective living standard indicators and the conventions used to calculate the cost of dependent children. . The subjective approach does not give a robust identification of a single equivalence scale. It does, however, provide a set of possible equivalence scales; for instance, the adult equivalent for a child under 14 ranges from 0.15 to 0.8, while standard equivalence scales are based on a convention, such as 0.3 for the OECD-modified equivalence scale. Thus, for studies using these instruments, or for public policy, it may be preferable to consider a set of equivalence scales rather than just a single scale.}

Three subjective poverty lines are presented: one the Financial Satisfaction Poverty Line, two the Leyden Poverty Line, and three the Subjective Well-Being Poverty Line. The first two poverty lines are based on subjective questions regarding income and economic welfare while the last concept focuses on satisfaction with life as a whole. The results obtained are compared with each other and with results derived using ’objective’ measures and official figures.}

Considering the various dimensions in which individuals suffer privations, without denying the importance of monetary income, the aim of this paper is to present the qualitative aspects of poverty through the identification of those life dimensions most valued by people themselves. The study is based on Sen's Capability Approach and on completing the first steps of the methodology for calculating a multidimensional poverty index, pro-posed by Alkire and Foster (2007). Survey respondents were residents in the municipality of Silveira Martins, located in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul. It was possible to identify nine dimensions of poverty as the most valued by household research targets.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION The wealth index is a commonly-used measure of socio-economic position (SEP) in low- and middle-income settings, but there is concern that it is strongly influenced by community-level as well as household-level factors. Subjective SEP indicators are infrequently used in health research.   METHODS We use data from 11 280 households included in the Malawi Integrated Household Survey 2004/5. We compare the wealth index with four subjective measures of SEP: perceived food consumption adequacy, perceived overall consumption adequacy, an economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency. The wealth index is compared with each subjective SEP measure in terms of: (i) agreement of classification of households, (ii) targeting accuracy with respect to US\$1-a-day poverty based on consumption expenditure, and (iii) the socio-economic processes (household- and community-level) giving rise to the SEP scores.   RESULTS Each subjective SEP indicator resulted in considerable differential classification of households compared with the wealth index. Three measures of subjective SEP (perceived food consumption adequacy, economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency) identified a higher proportion of dollar-a-day poor households as poor than the wealth index. The wealth index was strongly influenced by community infrastructure, but all subjective SEP indicators were free from strong community-level influence.   CONCLUSION The strengths and limitations of any measure of SEP depend on the context and purpose for which it is being used. In these data, the wealth index was strongly influenced by community infrastructure, whereas the subjective SEP measures were not, perhaps allowing analyses using them to disentangle household and community influences. Several subjective measures also corresponded to dollar-a-day poverty more strongly than the wealth index. Subjective measures may therefore be preferable to the wealth index in some circumstances, although they have their own set of potential biases.}

Poverty in the EU is normally defined in terms of income thresholds defined at the level of each member state. However, the enlargement of the EU and the consequent widening of the gap in living standards between the richest and the poorest member states has had the consequence that a country such as Ireland perform poorly in comparison with a number of the New Member States (NMS) despite enjoying obvious advantages in terms of material living standards. Such paradoxical findings have produced a number of different but interrelated responses. The first focuses on the limitations imposed by an entirely national frame of reference. An alternative critique takes as its starting point the fact that low income is an unreliable indicator of poverty. In this paper we seek to explore the strength of both critiques by comparing the outcomes associated with measuring being 'at risk of poverty' and consistent poverty at both national and EU levels. Our analysis suggest that it is possible to develop an approach that would allow us to achieve the stated EU objective of assessing the scale of exclusion from minimally acceptable level of standards of living in individual countries while also measuring the extent to which the whole population of Europe is sharing in the benefits of high average prosperity.}

Heterogeneity in needs calls for extra information. We argue that subjective welfare data offer a credible means of testing utility consistency across different needs groups. A case study of Russia's official poverty lines shows how revealed preference tests can be used in conjunction with qualitative information on needs heterogeneity.

In both China and the majority of low- and middle-income countries, systematic research on the relationship between subjective poverty and the mental health of the elderly needs to be expanded. In this study, we aimed to examine how social capital, including bonding and bridging social capital, mediate the relationship between subjective poverty and mental health among the elderly in China. Relying on the 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) data, we used ordered probit (oprobit) regression, propensity score matching (PSM), and instrumental variable (IV) regression to estimate the effects of subjective poverty on mental health. The results indicate that subjective poverty has a significant negative impact on the mental health of the elderly in China. More importantly, social capital, including bonding and bridging social capital, partially mediates the relationship between subjective poverty and mental health. We believe that, in the process of implementing the government’s healthy aging strategy in China, society and government should recognize the importance and value of subjective poverty governance for the elderly. In particular, the construction of a social relationship network that centers on bonding and bridging social capital could be instrumental in dealing with subjective poverty among the elderly and safeguarding their mental health and wellbeing.}

Using five waves of RLMS (Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, 1994-2000) individual panel data we conclude that working in undeclared additional activities (informal sector) helps individuals to avoid monetary poverty and even feel richer in spite of instability of informal sector. Individuals, having only one declared activity, have the highest probability to be poor and to feel poor.}

We explore possible factors contributing to these differences in health outcomes, including socioeconomic position, living conditions, and the perception of control over one’s own life. We analyzed the 2010 National Values Survey database (n = 15,693). Interviewers assessed and classified participants into one of five categories combining skin color and ethnicity: white, light brown, dark brown, Afro-descendant, or indigenous. Health outcomes were measured as self-rated health and happiness scales. Household socioeconomic position, neighborhood socioeconomic position, satisfaction of needs, and perceived control over life were considered as potential mediating variables. We observed that people classified as light brown and dark brown reported lower levels of self-rated health and happiness compared to people classified as whites. These differences were mainly due to socioeconomic position, living conditions, and perception of control over life. Afro-descendants also had lower levels of self-reported health. The results suggest that, in Mexico, there are health inequities associated with skin color and ethnicity. Although a significant proportion of these disparities are related to socioeconomic position, other processes may be involved (e.g. perception of control). Our findings can inform policies aimed to reduce racist disparities in health among the Mexican population.}

All indicators of poverty, regardless of whether they are based on material deprivation or human capital, or whether they are multidimensional or unidimensional, try to gauge the welfare of the individual. The most popular method is financial poverty, which takes into account control over marketable products and services. Indicators that are simple to grasp allow for comparisons across time and geographies and are connected to a household’s current situation. This analysis for Albania is based on INSTAT data using surveys such as the Household Budget Survey and Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The latter provides two types of data: a. cross-sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions; and b. longitudinal data pertaining to individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over a four-year period.}

Applying the method to data from the German Socio-Economic Panel yields a temporally stable poverty line similar to the definition provided by the Statistical Office of the European Commission.

A context-specific poverty line would be more consistent with preferences. This paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence that the contrary holds and that the national poverty line is more appropriate for comparing living standards among the poor, at least under prevailing conditions in Mozambique and Ghana. The problem lies in the risk of downscaling the burden associated with cheap-calorie diets and the low nonfood component of the rural poor. The paper illustrates how observed behavior may neither reveal preferences nor detect heterogeneous preferences among the poor. Rather, the consumption pattern is the upshot of the poverty condition itself. Poverty is confused with preferences if observed cheap-calorie diets are seen as a matter of taste, whereas in fact they reflect a lack of means to consume a preferred diet of higher quality, as food Engel curve estimates indicate. Likewise, a smaller nonfood component is not a matter of a particular distaste, but an adaptation to the fact that various nonfood items (such as transport) and basic services (such as electricity and health) are simply absent in rural areas.}

  abstract = {Equivalence scales are policy parameters for inequality measurement, tax deductions and subsidies. Thus, their accuracy is relevant both for budgets and social cohesion; however, their measurement is subject to debate regarding the underlying measure of welfare. Self-assessed insecurities in terms of clothing, housing and food—or basic needs—imply that at least some households are at lower levels of welfare than those that are meeting their needs. We use this to determine the increase in total expenditure required to meet their needs, on average, and thus we are able to calculate the implied equivalence scales. We compare these subjective scales to ones that arise from objective measures, such as expenditure shares on the same items. Our subjective scales are more consistent and plausible across all goods, and are similar to those arising from food expenditure shares. While scales arising from either housing or clothing expenditure shares are neither similar to those arising from food shares or basic needs adequacy nor are they plausible, given the plausibility rules we apply. Furthermore, the subjective equivalence scales are smaller than those proposed in the OECD-modified scale.}

  abstract = {Measuring poverty is crucial for designing public policies aimed at reducing social inequality and improving living conditions for the population. One common indicator, particularly in developed economies, is the poverty line, which is based on the income necessary to cover minimum expenses for a dignified and adequate life. This includes factors such as the cost of food, housing, transportation, and other essential goods and services. The calculation of the poverty line considers the consumption unit, which can refer to each individual (per capita) or include weighting based on the number of household members and their age.  The poverty line is a relative indicator, meaning it serves as a reference point, and it results in a binary model where a household is classified as either poor or non-poor. Additionally, data obtained from surveys such as the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) are used to calculate the poverty line.  This study proposes two main approaches. Firstly, the construction of multidimensional poverty lines (moving from a binary to a multinomial framework), including the definition of related auxiliary indicators. Secondly, the use of secondary data for the calculations, obtained from Eurostat, where the per capita income or weighted per capita income, as well as the per capita actual individual consumption, are employed. This allows for comparisons between NUTS3 regions and analysis of their evolution over time in Europe.}

  abstract = {This paper considers the measurement of poverty in the European Union (EU). Starting from a definition of poverty that is suitable for the European context, a flexible measurement framework is proposed based on the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke class of poverty measures. Three key issues need to be addressed in the measurement of poverty. First, one has to determine the appropriate metric of individual well-being. Second, a cut-off value or threshold needs to be established under which persons are considered to be poor. Third, it is necessary to outline an aggregation procedure to attain a poverty figure for society as a whole. In what follows, we discuss the different answers that are implicit in the poverty measures applied in this book* and the EU’s social strategy. The EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) are introduced as the main data source for poverty analysis in the EU. Finally, an illustration is provided of how the different conceptual choices in the measurement of poverty affect the empirical findings regarding the evolution of poverty between 2005 and 2009. It turns out that the selection of individual well-being metric and the choice between a county-specific and a pan-European poverty line strongly affect observed patterns of poverty in the EU. * Cantillon, B. and Vandenbroucke, F.

Apart from the positive but imperfect correlation between the household monetary income and subjective welfare, other factors influence that perception. We use the Economic Ladder Question (ELQ) in the Peruvian household surveys to analyze the factors determining economic welfare, employing an ordered logit model. Our research puts emphasis on those factors affected by policy. We show that more than 70\% of the population considers itself 'poor' in subjective terms, while according to the poverty line approach, the proportion is 44,6\%. This mismatch between subjective and objective measures means that, in urban and rural areas respectively, 53\% and 81\% of objective non-poor households subjectively consider themselves to be poor. Using the ELQ we were able to identify factors in determining subjective economic welfare that have been absent in previous research, including: (1) feelings of inclusion in the political and economic system; (2) participation in institutions with decision-making power; (3) the urban poverty characteristics of Lima; and (4) the importance of the reference group in welfare evaluation. The paper concludes by recommending specific policies that focus on the determinants of subjective welfare and by suggesting the importance of using the ELQ to improve the design and evaluation of public policy within a social management framework.}

The first component is the size of the poverty that is explained by the lack of incomes that are related to a specific threshold of a geographical area (within); the second component is the result of an absolute homogeneous poverty line (between). It is found that the differences in poverty indicators among geographical areas depend on homogeneous normative threshold that is taken as reference: a low threshold entails poverty indicators that are explained by the lack of incomes within each geographical area, while a high threshold entails poverty indicators that are explained by the differences in lack of incomes between geographical areas.}

What accounts for these huge differences, and can they be understood within a common global definition of poverty? For all except the poorest countries, the absolute, nutrition-based, poverty lines found in practice tend to behave more like relative lines, in that they are higher for richer countries. Prevailing methods of setting absolute lines allow ample scope for such relativity, even when nutritional norms are common across countries. Both macro data on poverty lines across the world and micro data on subjective perceptions of poverty are consistent with a weak form of relativity that combines absolute consumption needs with social-inclusion needs that are positive for the poorest but rise with a countrys mean consumption. The strong form of relativism favored by some developed countries -- whereby the line is set at a fixed proportion of the mean -- emerges as the limiting case for very rich countries.}

The subject of observation is disposable income per equalized member. We attempt to assess income inequality based on a Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. Another point of observation is the development of the poverty level. The poverty gap is assessed using a Sen index. Special attention is paid to groups of households according to economic activity (employed, self-employed, pensioner, unemployed, other). Using Scheffe’s method of contrast, specific pairs of demonstrable differences between levels of economic activity are detected. The poverty of individual groups is assessed based on poverty level and risk-of-poverty index. The performed analyses showed that the total incomes of households within the given period were increasing, even though the year-on-year increments were gradually decreasing. The most significant increase was observed in the incomes of unemployed people, the least significant increase in the incomes of self-employed people. Social policy in the Czech Republic does mitigate poverty; however, it does not prevent the unfair development of incomes for various groups of households.}

These are important questions for child allowances, social benefits and to assess the cost of children over the life-cycle for example. The latter is also interesting from a theoretical point of view, especially if future events are allowed to be uncertain. We discuss equivalence scales in an intertemporal setting with uncertainty. To estimate equivalence scales we use subjective data on satisfaction with life and satisfaction with income to represent the welfare level. Because satisfaction is measured on a discrete scale we use limited dependent variable models in estimation. The results are based on a panel from German households (GSOEP). Using satisfaction with life data we find that larger households do not need any additional income to be as satisfied with their life as a couple. Using satisfaction with income, however, indicates that an increase in the household size leads to a significant drop in the satisfaction with their income. This result is used to compute equivalence scales.}

The current income-based measure of poverty presents only part of measuring poverty status as a whole. The consumption basket is wrongly taken by those of economic inclination to wholly represent the entire, even nonmonetary valued, range of poverty. The paper approaches this dilemma using a participatory and community-driven approach where the subjective views of people are used to define and categorize the poor, contrary to the poverty line approach. Such categorization was based on the perceived wellness of life and what made/denied wellness. A survey follows to explore the quantitative scope of poverty. This participatory, qualitative and quantitative mix of method, it is argued, provides for ascertaining organizational accountability in terms of the relevance of programme targeting and outreach as well as performance measurement over time. The method can also be used to deepen current participatory poverty assessments that simply stop at defining and identifying poverty causes, effects and solutions.}

Most countries experienced initial drops in output during transition, followed by recovery in the second half of the 1990s. The path of transition in the Western Balkans has however been particularly uneven. The effects of transition also seem to have been more traumatic and persistent in the Western Balkans, and nostalgia for the past appears to be more prevalent here than in other former communist regions. Such dissatisfaction has important implications for the political economy of further reforms. This paper aims to inform policy by complementing the analysis of standard macro-level measures of inequality and poverty with a household-level analysis of subjective perceptions of poverty. We find that many more people appear to feel poor than are classified as such using purely income-based measures. Uncertainty, in particular related to expectations of future income and vulnerability to shocks, appears to be a key driver behind this discrepancy.}

  abstract = {Summary Conventional measures of poverty relate household per capita income or expenditure estimates to a poverty line derived from a nutrition‐based estimate of minimum income or expenditure. There is widespread criticism of this approach on the grounds that it fails to capture important dimensions of poverty and that it often fails to reflect subjective perceptions well‐being. This article argues that the polemic on method is misdirected; it confuses measure of poverty with measure of well‐being and counting problems with concept problems. But this debate is really a metaphor; the underlying and justifiable concern is with control over the design and implementation of development programmes and projects especially anti‐poverty projects. Changing the form and content of information on poverty is part of a broader process of empowerment. Resume La mesure de la pauvrete et la pauvrete des mesures En termes de la conception et de la mise en vigueur des politiques publiques en general et des politiques de reduction de la pauvrete en particulier, l'information sur l'identite meme de ces pauvres est des plus importantes. En termes diachroniques, ce fut le projet primordial de l'economie welfariste de determiner que la maximalisation de la croissance par voie des mecanismes du marche correspondait effectivement a l'optimalisation welfariste; or cette intention se vit interdite par le fait qu'elle etait en elle‐meme incapable de s'adresser aux problemes qui decoulaient des changements dans la distribution des revenus. Aujourd'hui, les mesures conventionnelles de la pauvrete ont trait aux revenus par individu et par menage, ou bien, a des estimations des depenses relativement a un bareme de pauvrete fonde sur des estimations des revenus minima ou des depenses basees a leur tour sur l'alimentation. Une telle analyse de la pauvrete relativement a un bareme permet par contre de se focaliser sur des questions qui afferent a la distribution des revenus. Cette approche est tres critiquee, car elle negligerait de capter certaines importantes dimensions de la pauvrete, et en raison du fait qu'elle manquerait souvent de reflechir certaines perceptions erronees de bien‐etre. L'auteur de cet article propose que la polemique sur les methodes est faussement orientee: celles‐ci melangent les mesures de pauvrete avec les mesures de bien‐etre, et melangent les problemes de comptabilisation avec les problemes plus conceptuels. Les theories afferant aux besoins humains placent leur emphase sur les besoins materiels la ou la pauvrete absolue reste toujours l'inquietude primordiale du developpe‐ment. En pareils cas, la justification pour l'inclusion de besoins de deuxieme ordre tels que la concession du pouvoir dans la conception meme des politiques de reduction de la pauvrete semblerait decouler du role critique que jouent ces theories dans la reponse aux besoins materiels, plutot que de repondre a leur valeur intrinseque.

Historicamente, el proyecto principal de la politicas de biemestar social fue establecer que la maximizacion del crecimiento a traves de mecanismos mercantiles fuera consistente con la optimizacion del bienestar, pero este proyecto fracaso porque no fue capaz de resolver los problemas de una distribucion de ingresos en proceso de cambio. Actualmente, las medidas convencionales contra la pobreza relacionan los ingresos familiares per capita a la estimacion de gastos con un minimo vital derivado de un calculo minimo de ingresos y gastos basado en la nutricion. Este minimo vital permite un centro de atencion preciso en cuestiones de distribucion de ingresos. Existe una critica generalizada a este enfoque, en razon de su fracaso en capturar importantes dimensiones de pobreza y en reflejar las percepciones subjetivas del bienestar. Este articulo argumenta que la polemica sobre el metodo esta mal dirigida: confunde la medicion de la pobreza con la medicion del bienestar, y los problemas de calculo con los problemas de concepto. Las teorias sobre las necesidades humanas dan prioridad a las necesidades materiales en cualquier lugar en el que la pobreza absoluta continua siendo el mayor motivo de preocupacion en el proceso de desarrollo. Y cuando este es el caso, la justificacion para incorporar necesidades de segundo orden como el otorgamiento de facultades para el diseno de pautas de reduccion de pobreza viene de su papel instrumental en servir a las necesidades materiales y no de su valor intrinseco.}

  abstract = {The challenges faced in calibrating poverty and welfare measures to objective data have long been recognized. Until recently, most economists have resisted a seemingly obvious solution, namely to ask people themselves:``Do you feel poor?``The paper studies the case for and against this approach. It is argued that, while one would not want to use self-assessments as welfare metrics in their own right, there is scope for using such data to help calibrate multidimensional measures. Indeed, the idea of a``social subjective poverty line``(below which people tend to think they are poor, but above which they do not) is arguably the most conceptually appealing way of defining poverty. However, the paper points to a number of concerns that have received insufficient attention, including the choice of covariates, survey design issues, measurement errors, frame-of-reference effects, and latent heterogeneity in personality traits and personal tradeoffs. Directions for future research are identified.}

The sensitivity analysis is applied to household survey data from 17 Latin American countries, which include 92\% of the population in the region. By varying these parameters within reasonable boundaries we found that the proportion of poor could be said to be either 20\% or 66\%. Furthermore, the ranking of countries with respect to poverty is highly sensitive to the underlying choices for poverty measurement. We also perform sensitivity analysis to the use of different poverty lines and poverty indexes, which are issues that have been explored much more in the literature. Even after considering these elements, the most sensitive choice appears to be the method used to adjust for misreporting. These findings point, first, to the need to be explicit about the underlying assumptions behind poverty statistics, second, to the need to perform sensitivity analysis when estimating levels and trends in poverty, and third, to the importance of establishing a set of conventions that would be accepted as “best practices” in estimating poverty indexes.}

This index has a convenient graphical representation-the ``poverty box``. Using the proposed poverty line and the example of ranking the level of rural poverty in Chinese provinces, the study demonstrates how poverty intensity replicates the poverty rankings of the Sen family of poverty indices and captures most of the information content of higher-order FGT indices.

Although these are distinct perspectives, income poverty and perceptions of financial difficulties are likely to be interrelated: low income (especially if it persists) is likely to negatively affect perceptions of financial difficulties and, as recently suggested by the behavioral economics literature, (past) subjective sentiment may in return influence individual's income generating ability and poverty status. The aim of this paper is to determine the extent of these dynamic cross-effects between both processes. Using Luxembourg survey data, our main result highlights the existence of a feedback effect from past perceived financial difficulties on current income poverty suggesting that subjective perceptions can have objective effects on an individual's behaviour and outcomes.}

National data from both countries in the early 1980s are analyzed. In regressions of reported minimum income, corrections are made for the omission of income components and selective non‐response. For the first time the relationship between fixed expenditures and the MIQ is examined. Factors significantly related to reported minimum income include household income, household composition, age, education, sex, region, fixed expenditures, and whether the household experienced recent income changes. The income elasticity appears to be smaller in the U.S. than in the Netherlands, while the effects of other socioeconomic factors are greater. On average, the resulting subjective income thresholds are above official poverty lines, but more so in the U.S. than in the Nerherlands. Whether thresholds based on answers to MIQs should be regarded as poverty lines remains open to question.}

Yet they draw on abstract, often dated evidence and arbitrary judgements, and on comparisons across the income distribution rather than focusing on minimum requirements. Budget standards provide more tangible comparisons of the minimum required by different household types. The Minimum Income Standard (MIS) method, now established in several countries, applies a common methodological framework for compiling budgets, based on public deliberations. This article draws for the first time on results across countries. In all of the four countries examined, it identifies an under-estimation by the OECD scale of the relative cost of children compared to adults, and, in three of the four, an under-estimation of the cost of singles compared to couples. This more systematically corroborates previous, dispersed evidence, and helps explain which specific expenditure categories influence these results. These results have high policy relevance, showing greater proportions of low income households to contain children than standard income distribution data. While no single equivalence scale can be universally accurate, making use of evidence based directly on benchmarks such as MIS can help inform public priorities in tackling low income.}

In this formulation, a household is said to be experiencing monetary poverty if its annual per-capita consumption spending is less than the poverty line of 130,375 CFA Franc. The study uses the 2009 National Survey on Household Living Conditions administered by the National Institute for Statistics and demography (INSD), along with a Random Utility modeling framework to explain households' per-capita consumption choices and thus poverty status. We then specify multivariate probit and logit models to describe the choice probabilities, and uncover the parameters using Maximum Likelihood Methods.  The results show that education, along with other covariates is a key determinant of households' spending choices and poverty status in Burkina Faso. In fact, compared to households with uneducated heads, those headed by someone with a primary, secondary, and higher education are respectively 1.45 times, 4.13 times, and 18.04 times more likely to spend a per-capita amount above the poverty threshold of 130,375 CFA franc. These results suggest that education could successfully be used as an effective policy tool to reduce the incidence of chronic poverty in Burkina Faso.}

  abstract = {Poverty has always been studied in a world of certainty. However, if the aim of studying poverty is not only improving the well-being of households who are currently poor, but also preventing people from becoming poor in the future, a new forward looking perspective must be adopted. For thinking about appropriate forward-looking anti-poverty interventions (i.e. interventions that aim to prevent or reduce future poverty rather than alleviate current poverty), the critical need then is to go beyond a cataloging of who is currently poor and who is not, to an assessment of households’ vulnerability to poverty. This study analyses a panel dataset on a representative sample of 150 rural households interviewed in 2007 and 2008 in the Amathole District Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province to empirical assess the dynamics of poverty and estimate the determinants of households’ vulnerability to poverty. The result of the study indicates that the number of vulnerable households is significantly larger than for the currently poor households; the vulnerability index was found to be 0,62 compared to 0,56 headcount index in 2008. This implies that while 56 percent of the sampled households are poor (ex post) in 2008, 62 percent are vulnerable to becoming poor (ex ante) in future. The result of the Probit model shows that the age, level of education and occupation of the household head, dependency ratio, exposure to idiosyncratic risks and access to credit are statistically significant in explaining a households’ vulnerability to poverty.}

  abstract = {The measurement of health-expenditure related impoverishment as a proxy of financial risk protection is regularly used as an indicator of progress towards universal health coverage. However, the use of this indicator is greatly sensitive to analysts' choices and data sources, making comparisons across time and countries challenging. We report the results of a sensitivity analysis of critical methodological choices in estimating health-related financial impoverishment in Cambodia from 2009 to 2017. We include in our analysis: the construction and data sources for consumption aggregates and out-of-pocket health estimates; the use of international and national absolute and relative poverty thresholds (defined by share of household food consumption); and, time and regional price adjustment methods and index sources. Marginal changes substantially affected estimates at the national and regional levels among households. In most cases, the choice of poverty thresholds and temporal and regional deflators had a significant effect. An increase of 0.01 USD in the average daily per capita poverty line resulted in relative increases in impoverished incidences of 2.90\% to 2.62\% for 2009, and 3.06\% to 2.95\% for 2014. From 2013 onwards, estimates for impoverishment in rural areas based on median food consumption were often significantly higher than estimates using official poverty lines. The high sensitivity of the impoverishment indicator cautions against its use in assessing health-related financial hardship and protection, especially with low and absolute poverty lines. In the context of low- and middle-income countries, assessing financial hardship in relative terms by using measures such as catastrophic health expenditure, complemented with research on coping strategies and their socio-economic effects on households, may be more conducive to policymaking goals and progress toward achieving universal health coverage.}

Using the National Survey of Quality of Life (NSQL) of DANE at year 2011, a logit model of discrete choice and stan dardized coefficients is estimated for explaining subjective poverty. The results show that although income has the greatest weight in the perception of poverty, having good nutrition is established as the most basic capability for a Colombian to deve lop other capabilities. Furthermore, situations of violence such as forced displacement have a significant weight in the perception of poverty of those who suffer them. Finally, it is evidenced that Colombians tend to be conformed with their social ties, showing themselves satisfied with aspects of life associated to the capability of functioning in society, even when they consider them selves as poor.

En los pocos estudios sobre la pobreza y el desarrollo humano, desarrollados por autores como Townsend (1979), Argyle (1999), Sen (2000), Deaton (2001), Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2002) y Ravallion (2012), se ha generado una gran discusión acerca de qué conceptos y juicios permiten decir que alguien está en situación de pobreza, partiendo de enfoques objetivos (basados netamente en el ingreso y las necesidades básicas insatisfechas) hasta llegar a analizar la pobreza desde muchos ámbitos, a saber, los enfoques multidimensionales. En este contexto, toma importancia el enfoque subjetivo de la pobreza, que permite conocer este problema desde la propia voz de quienes la padecen. Es importante señalar que la pobreza objetiva se define como una situación de carencia de ingresos para adquirir una canasta básica de consumo aceptable socialmente, así como una situación de condiciones materiales inadecuadas para vivir. Por el contrario, la pobreza subjetiva considera la percepción de los individuos u hogares sobre su bienestar y cotidianidad, definiéndose como aquella situación en la cual, pese a tenerse ingresos que superan el mínimo de subsistencia, se gana menos de lo que se necesita para no sentirse pobre. En otras palabras, es el grado de insatisfacción con la situación en la que se está, al no tener el nivel de vida deseado. Así, hogares catalogados como pobres objetivos puede que no se autoperciban como pobres, mientras que quienes no son ubicados como pobres puede que sí se consideren pobres al no tener el nivel de vida que desearían tener. Hay que mencionar, además, que durante el siglo xx se desarrollaron tres concepciones alternativas de la pobreza. La primera, basada en la subsistencia, se restringe al individuo y su hogar y enuncia que se es pobre si el ingreso del hogar no cubre los satisfactores básicos mínimos para mantener la eficiencia física. La segunda, se fundamenta en las necesidades básicas, recoge las nece2 Es importante mencionar que la pobreza dejó de considerarse como norma de la vida humana y se empezó a concebir como una problemática social cuando los países industrializados tuvieron importantes mejoras en las condiciones de vida, quedando demostrado que era posible sacar a las personas de esa condición tan desafortunada y llevarlas a una de bienestar (situación donde se reivindica la dignidad humana, hay poder de decisión y dominio sobre la propia vida). Factores asociados a la pobreza subjetiva en Colombia 14 desarro. soc. no. 78, bogotá, primer semestre de 2017, pp. 11-57, issn 0120-3584, e-issn 1900-7760, doi: 10.13043/dys.78.1 sidades de subsistencia y se extiende a la comunidad al incluir la necesidad de servicios públicos, salud y educación. La tercera, basada en la privación relativa, según Townsend (1979) supera la limitación física y material de los otros dos enfoques al ser una formulación social más amplia y rigurosa, puesto que se es pobre o se está en privación relativa si no se puede tener la condición de vida requerida para actuar como miembro de una sociedad. Rompiendo con el enfoque relativista de la pobreza defendido por Townsend (1979), aparece el enfoque absolutista y multidimensional de Sen (2000), el cual será de gran importancia en el presente trabajo. Este es el enfoque de capabilities y functionings, traducido como capacidades y funcionamientos (o realizaciones), en el cual se entienden las capacidades que tiene una persona como “las libertades fundamentales de que disfruta para llevar el tipo de vida que tiene razones para valorar” (Sen, 2000, p. 114), y los funcionamientos como “las diversas cosas que una persona puede valorar hacer o ser” con las mercancías disponibles (Sen, 2000, p. 99). Desde esta perspectiva, “la pobreza debe concebirse como la privación de capacidades básicas y no meramente como la falta de ingreso, que es el criterio habitual con el que se identifica la pobreza” (Sen, 2000, p. 114). Por otra parte, las mediciones de pobreza pueden ubicarse dentro de medidas objetivas monetarias y no monetarias. En particular, las concepciones de pobreza basadas en la subsistencia integran las medidas monetarias de pobreza, ya que se reducen al nivel de ingresos del hogar o individuo. El enfoque de capacidades de Sen (2000), al igual que los enfoques basados en necesidades básicas y privaciones relativas, sin perder su carácter objetivo, corresponde a medidas no monetarias de pobreza, puesto que cada una tiene su propia unidad de medida, la cual no es reductible a valores monetarios. Considerando lo anterior, la novedad del presente trabajo de investigación radica en el hecho de aislarse de las mediciones netamente monetarias y tratar el problema de la pobreza desde un punto de vista subjetivo, a saber, desde la autopercepción de los colombianos con respecto a su situación. En este sentido, el objetivo central del presente trabajo es examinar la asociación de variables de satisfacción con la autopercepción de pobreza subjetiva en Colombia, teniendo en cuenta características del individuo y su entorno.

Este documento tiene cinco secciones. La primera sección presenta un recorrido por la literatura más relevante sobre pobreza y particularmente, percepción subjetiva de la pobreza a nivel nacional e internacional. La segunda hace una revisión sobre la percepción subjetiva de la pobreza, el enfoque de capacidades de Sen y la economía de la felicidad. La tercera expone el modelo empírico de percepción subjetiva de pobreza para Colombia en el año 2011. La cuarta presenta una caracterización de los individuos que se perciben como pobres en Colombia. La quinta muestra los resultados de la estimación del modelo propuesto. La sexta y última sección presenta las conclusiones generales y recomendaciones derivadas de este trabajo.}

Among the choices the LIS microdata allows a researcher, e.g. income definition, income accounting unit, etc., is the choice of family equivalence scale, a method for estimating economic well-being by adjusting income for measurable differences in need.    The range of potential equivalence scales that can and are being used in the ten LIS countries and elsewhere to adjust incomes for size and related differences in need span a wide spectrum. The purpose of this paper is to review the available equivalence scales and to test the sensitivity of various income inequality and poverty measures to choice of equivalence scale using the LIS database. The results of our analysis indicate that choice of equivalence scale can sometimes systematically affect absolute and relative levels of poverty; and inequality and therefore rankings of countries (or population subgroups within countries). Because of these sensitivities, one must carefully consider summary statements and policy implications derived from cross-national comparisons of poverty and/or inequality.}

The exogeneity of the initial state is strongly rejected and could result in considerable overstatement of the effects of the explanatory factors. The results of the bivariate probit model do indicate that education of the household head, per capita acreage cultivated and changes in household size are significantly related to the probability of being poor in 2002 irrespective of the poverty status in 1998. For those households who were poor in 1998, the probability of being poor in 2002 was significantly influenced by household size, value of livestock owned and mean time to services, while residence in the Northern region was a significant variable in determining the probability of being poor in 2002 for households that were not poor in 1998.

  abstract = {Food security is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon. As such, its measurement may entail and benefit from the combination of both “qualitative-subjective” and “quantitative-objective” indicators. Yet, the evidence on the external validity of subjective-type information is scarce, especially using representative household surveys. The aim of this paper is to compare information on self-perceived food consumption adequacy from the subjective modules of household surveys with standard quantitative indicators, namely calorie consumption, dietary diversity and anthropometry. Datasets from four countries are analyzed: Albania, Madagascar, Nepal and Indonesia. Simple descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, contingency tables and multivariate regression show that the “subjective” indicator is at best poorly correlated with standard quantitative indicators. The paper concludes that while subjective food adequacy indicators may provide insight on the vulnerability dimension of food insecurity, they are too blunt an indicator for food insecurity targeting. An effort towards developing improved subjective food security modules that are contextually sensitive should go hand in hand with research into how to improve household survey data for food security measurement along other dimensions of the phenomenon, particularly calorie consumption.}

The novel feature is that linear programming is used to deduce the diet that minimizes cost and guarantees survival. Nonfood items are also explicitly budgeted and amount to about one quarter of the cost of subsistence. A series of least cost diets are calculated with increasingly demanding nutritional requirements for twenty countries using prices from ICP 2011. The aim is to see which requirements rationalize the spending pattern of the poor. The ‘reduced basic’ model does the job. When the cost of the nonfood items are added to the cost of the ‘reduced basic’ diet, the resulting Linear Programming Poverty Line (LPPL) averages \$1.88 per day across the poor countries in the sample. The same model rationalizes both the spending pattern of the poor and the World Bank Poverty Line. The LPPL has the advantages that it is (1) clearly related to survival and well being, (2) comparable across time and space since the same nutritional requirements are used everywhere, (3) adjusts consumption patterns to local prices, (4) presents no index number problems since solutions are always in local prices, and (5) requires only readily available information, namely, the prices in ICP or equivalent.}

Frequently used global data come from the Penn World Table (PWT) and the World Bank's World Development Indicators; a substantial fraction of the world is also covered in the PPP accounts produced by the OECD and the European Union. This paper provides an overview of how these data are constructed, and discusses both the theory and the practical problems of implementing it. All of these data are underpinned by the International Comparison Program (ICP), which collects data on prices worldwide. The most recent round of the ICP was for 2005 with final results published in early 2008; version 7.0 of the Penn World Table will soon incorporate these results. The 2005 ICP, like earlier rounds, involved substantial revisions to previous data, most notably revising downwards the size of the Chinese (40 percent smaller) and Indian (36 percent) economies. We discuss the reasons for the revisions, and assess their plausibility. We focus on four important areas: how to handle international differences in quality, the treatment of urban and rural areas of large countries such as China, India, and Brazil, how to estimate prices for government services, health, and education, and the effects of the regional structure of the ICP. All of these affect the interpretation of previous data, as well as the current revisions. We discuss previous revisions of the PWT, and their effects on various kinds of econometric analysis. The paper concludes with health warnings that should be kept in mind when using these data, which are not always suitable for the purposes to which they are put. Some international comparisons are close to impossible, even in theory, and in others, the practical difficulties make comparison exceedingly hazardous.}

Poverty, however, has multiple dimensions, hence this paper explores the improvement in other social deprivations. An analysis of poverty from a multidimensional perspective shows the prevalence of multiple overlapping deprivations among the poor. This paper analyses the change in multidimensional poverty in India between 1999 and 2006 using National Family and Health Surveys. We find a strong reduction in national poverty driven relatively more by some of the standard of living indicators, such as electricity, housing condition, access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities, than other social indicators. The reduction, however, has not been uniform across different population subgroups and the pattern of reduction across states has been less pro-poor that of income poverty. In addition, the poorer subgroups have shown slower progress, widening the inter-group disparity in multidimensional poverty. In order to examine trends among the poorest of the poor, we define two additional subgroups of the poor and find that multidimensional poverty reduction has been accompanied by even stronger reductions in the share of the poorest of the poor by both definitions. The in-depth analysis pursued in this paper can also be conducted for other developing countries.}

The global poverty number is estimated by the World Bank as a worldwide count of people who live below a common international poverty line. This line, loosely referred to as the dollar-a-day line, is calculated as an average over the world’s poorest countries of their national poverty lines expressed in international dollars. The average is then converted back to local currency to calculate each country’s counts of those living below the line. The counts come from household surveys, the number and coverage of which have steadily increased over the years. The conversion of national poverty lines to international currency and the conversion of the global line back to local currency are both done using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates from the various rounds of the International Comparison Program (ICP). These PPPs, unlike market exchange rates, are constructed as multilateral price indexes using directly observed consumer prices in many countries. This paper is about the construction of the PPPs and their effect on the poverty estimates. In the first dollar-a-day poverty calculations, the World Bank (1990) used price indexes for GDP, but this practice was later improved by the use of price indexes for household consumption. Yet even this may be misleading if the price indexes for national aggregate consumption are different from those relevant for people who live at or around the global poverty line. Price indexes are weighted averages}

The good news is that we have seen greater progress against poverty in the developing world in recent times-indeed, a faster pace of progress against extreme poverty than the rich world saw over a period of 100 years or more of economic development. However, continuing progress is far from assured. High and rising inequality has stalled progress against poverty in many countries. We are seeing generally rising relative poverty in the rich world as a whole over recent decades. And even in the developing world, there has been less progress in reaching the poorest, who risk being left behind, and a great many people in the emerging middle class remain highly vulnerable to falling back into poverty. The Economics of Poverty strives to support well-informed efforts to put in place effective policies to assure continuing success in reducing poverty in all its dimensions. The book reviews critically the past and present debates on the central policy issues of economic development everywhere. How much poverty is there? Why does poverty exist? What can be done to eliminate poverty? Martin Ravallion provides an accessible new synthesis of current knowledge on these issues. It does not assume that readers know economics already. Those new to economics get a lot of help along the way in understanding its concepts and methods. Economics lives though its relevance to real world problems, and here the problem of global poverty is both the central focus and a vehicle for learning. Available in OSO:}

  abstract = {Many surveys contain a wealth of subjective questions that are at first glance rather exciting. Examples include ``How important is leisure time to you?`` ``How satisfied are you with yourself?``; or ``How satisfied are you with your work?`` Yet despite easy availability, this is one data source that economists rarely use. In fact, the unwillingness to rely on such questions marks an important divide between economists and other social scientists. This neglect does not come from disinterest. Most economists would probably agree that the variables these questions attempt to uncover are interesting and important. But they doubt whether these questions elicit meaningful answers. These doubts are, however, based on a priori skepticism rather than on evidence. This ignores a large body of experimental and empirical work that has investigated the meaningfulness of answers to these questions. Our primary objective in this paper is to summarize this literature for an audience of economists. Thereby turning a vague implicit distrust into an explicit position grounded in facts. Having summarized the findings, we integrate them into a measurement error framework so as to understand what they imply for empirical research relying on subjective data. Finally, in order to calibrate the extent of the measurement error problem, we perform some simple empirical work using specific subjective questions.}

  abstract = {Abstract Natural disaster is a key exogenous driver to unpredictable risk of uncertainty and cost of economic loss. GDP loss at national economy and welfare loss at household level in the world are major costs of natural disasters. The cost that is a burden to households could change on income distribution and household income vertically and horizontally and then their livelihood and welfare. This relationship makes a curiosity of whether natural disaster could change income distribution at the household level in developing countries, where socio-economic vulnerable groups exist so that an alternative policy option can be explored to minimize such bad effects on socio-economic vulnerable groups and their livelihood and welfare. This article measures empirically the income distribution effects of natural disaster at household level based on primary data sets collected through a household survey in Sot Khola (stream) water basin using the Gini coefficient method. As a reference line, inequality and poverty levels are employed. Comprehensive and comparative analytical tools are used for testing the above research question based on two periodic data sets and information. As a result, the water shed areas had higher inequality and poverty level than national inequality line (0.33) before natural disaster. The residents were socio-economically and geographically vulnerable. The natural disaster damaged heavily tangible and nontangible assets, houses, household utensils, documents, dresses, valuable indigenous materials, emotions, and food grains. Thus the vulnerable households lost their assets and food grains in the disaster. Its distribution was acute at higher and lower altitude watershed areas and households than middle areas and households. In general, higher altitude watershed areas and households were more vulnerable than middle and then lower altitude watershed areas and households. Such acuteness of economic loss redistributed their inequality and poverty level in such a way. Thus, the vulnerable population became more vulnerable and the nonvulnerable population with their adaptive capacity became less vulnerable. Thus, the natural disaster has a negative income distribution effect at household level, particularly for vulnerable households with expansion of inequality and poverty.}

  abstract = {This report examines how minimum wages affect the income poverty of workers, their households, and the state. It does not question whether or not the minimum wage is a good policy: instead, it focuses on the tradeoffs in setting the minimum wage level. It takes as a starting point the literature on the wage and employment effects of minimum wages in Latin America and expands the discussion in three ways. First, the household is placed at the center of the debate. Poverty and inequality are measured at the level of the household, rather than at the individual level, to allow for employment and wage trade-offs among individuals who pool their income. Second, new research is presented on how the minimum wage affects groups whose labor market participation and success is considered ``vulnerable``: that is, youth, women, the low-skilled, and informal sector workers. Third, the implications of the minimum wage on wage and social expenditures of the government are measured. In the end, the report argues that the minimum wage by itself is not a sufficient tool for protecting the income of the poorest households, and that other social protection tools are necessary to complement it. The report has eight sections following the introduction. Chapter 2 presents a history of the minimum wage in LAC, the theory behind the functioning of the minimum wage, and empirical evidence from the OECD to lay a foundation for the Latin American experience. Chapter 3 presents an overview of the minimum wage in the Region, including a discussion of the definition of a minimum wage, institutional design, and who earns it. Chapter 4 focuses on the worker; it summarizes the existing literature, presents new evidence on the wage and employment effects of a minimum wage, and gives special attention to ``vulnerable`` labor market groups. Chapter 5 turns its attention to the household and presents the new (and only) evidence on the effects of the minimum wage on household poverty and inequality in LAC. Chapter 6 considers the state and discusses the cost of minimum wages to the government. Chapter 7 opens the discussion to the rest of the world and considers the lessons learned in other countries about setting, managing, and enforcing the minimum wage. Finally, chapter 8 concludes and presents policy considerations.}

  abstract = {The category of «minimum subsistence level» (SL), also referred to as «absolute poverty line», is one of the fundamental in the socio-economic policy of the modern country. The majority of social transfers depends on the size of the minimum subsistence level, i.e., the level of state support for vulnerable groups of the population; SL is the basis for setting a number of salaries in the budgetary sphere and, accordingly, the amount of tax revenues; the practice is common of reconciling the size of the minimum wage and the maximum level of income from which contributions to compulsory state social insurance are paid with SL. Thus, the SL forms a significant part of budget expenditures and at the same time revenues in the public finance system. The article presents the results of systematization of the principles and methods of calculating SL adopted in different countries. In particular, the characteristics of normative, structural and normative, statistical, resource-based and subjective approaches are given. Considering the well-founded claims to the current methodology for determining SL in Ukraine, the urgent need for its transformation is emphasized and the author’s vision of innovations is highlighted. The rationale is provided for introducing a structural and normative approach for the analysis, monitoring and forecasting of social development and welfare, differentiated by age groups, determined in accordance with participation in education and the labour market. The necessity is emphasized of: developing the norms of food consumption exclusively by medical specialists; using different SL structures; transition to the calculations of SL of the households with a separate definition of the so-called semi-fixed costs (at the level of 20-30\% of the food component of a person aged 20-64), which eliminates the use of disputable scales of equivalence. For the purpose of social assistance and calculation of its amount, it is proposed to focus on 40\% of the median official salary. The argument is that payouts from the budget depend on the revenues, i.e., taxes on legal wages, and, moreover, this is the threshold accepted in many European countries. The article provides examples of SL calculations, in particular, with the definition of the impact of various methodological schemes on the level and depth of poverty in the country, on the structure of the poor.As the final result the proposals are given for the use of SL in public policy.}

  abstract = {In developing countries like Ethiopia, our day-to-day formal and informal discourses are rarely out of poverty issues that can be linked directly or indirectly. Despite the determined effort of government and development agencies to reduce poverty and ensure sustainable development, poverty remains an everlasting challenge in the world. This study aims to examine rural household poverty and its determining factors using alternative poverty measurement approaches, in the case of Gozamin Woreda, East Gojjam Zone of Amhara Region. It used both objective and subjective based poverty analysis approaches, where the survey-based analysis and PPA of the study depend on randomly selected 242 and 42 sample households respectively. Using the cost of basic needs approach (CBN), the poverty line of the study area is estimated as 19.16 Birr per day per adult equivalent. The study engaged Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (FGT) group of poverty measures to assess the incidence, depth, and intensity of poverty, and decomposition was made across sample Kebeles and socio-economic variables. OLS, logit, and censored (Tobit) regression models were also applied to identify determining factors of household consumption expenditure, poverty incidence, depth, and severity. Accordingly, 35.12 \% of the population lives under poverty and it is closely estimated as 33.33\% using PPA. Poverty becomes sever challenge in the Dega agro-ecological areas of the Woreda, where 57.37\% of the population lives under poverty. Family size and agro-ecological location (from Kolla to Dega) have a significant negative effect on consumption expenditure, but positively affect poverty incidence, gap, and severity. Access to credit service, cooperative services, health extension services, and off-farm activities have a significant positive effect on consumption expenditure; while negatively affect the incidence, depth, and severity of poverty. PPA findings revealed that perception of the community towards poverty is beyond the conventional, income/consumption-based definition. Therefore, development policies and poverty reduction strategies should respond to rapid rural population growth. Moreover, Dega agro-ecological areas need particular attention all the way through poverty reduction efforts.}

  abstract = {The presented article is devoted to changes in the scale and qualitative characteristics of objective and subjective poverty in Russian society over the past 20 years. Based on the data of all-Russian empirical studies conducted by the Federal Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2003, 2013 and 2023, the dynamics of the number of objectively and subjectively poor Russians, the areas of intersection of these groups, their living conditions, their perception of their situation and ideas about the future of the country are traced. The obtained results indicate a noticeable reduction in both objective poverty (by income level) and subjective poverty (by self-assessment of their financial situation) among Russians over the past 20 years, which mainly occurred in the first half of this period. The reduction in the shares of objective and subjective poverty was accompanied by their divergence. As a result, an ever smaller share of Russians find themselves in the poverty zone simultaneously in both of these dimensions, and the portraits and characteristics of these groups differ increasingly. The objectively poor differ less in their assessments of their situation and opportunities in various spheres from the population as a whole, which indicates, on the one hand, the relatively shallow nature of income poverty, and on the other, the modest standard of living of the “typical Russian”. The subjectively poor are characterised by more noticeable differences from the population as a whole, in particular, negative assessments of many spheres of their lives. A similar situation is observed with the socio-psychological well-being of representatives of these groups: although over the past 20 years it has improved both among the poor by income and among the poor by self-assessment, positive changes in the first group occurred faster. As a result, the poor by self-assessment are characterised by a higher level of pessimism and anxiety compared to other Russians. In terms of assessments of Russia's development path, both objectively and subjectively the poor differ little from other Russians, demonstrating a public consensus: the population believes in a bright future for the country, but on the condition that it follows a special path that allows for social stability. Finally, it is important to note that the subjectively poor cannot be reduced to pensioners: the data confirm that this group is heterogeneous in its composition, which determines the absence of a clear portrait and the impossibility of identifying it as a \&quot;single addressee\&quot; of socio-economic policy.}

This study examines the impacts of rural households’ tourism participation on relative poverty using the survey data from 22 pro-poor tourism villages located in western China and the endogenous switching probit (ESP) model. The results show that participating in rural tourism reduces both objective and subjective relative poverty. However, it has no direct effect on subjective poverty, but exerts an indirect effect by decreasing objective poverty. Furthermore, heterogeneous effect analysis shows dual impacts. On the one hand, it brings reduction of relative poverty probability for tourism participants; on the other hand, it exacerbates the relative gap by individual endogenous capital endowments and narrows the gap by exogenous targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) policy interventions. Our findings extend theoretical significance of the pro-poor tourism arguments by clarifying the pro-poor effects and the pathways of rural tourism on both objective and subjective relative poverty at the household level. It also provides empirical evidence for improving the current anti-poverty policy related to rural tourism in China.}

Our analysis fills a gap in policy assessment research by examining the effect of introducing a cash universal child benefit (the program Family 500+ in 2016 in Poland) on income inequality and poverty, specifically child poverty. The analysis utilizes micro-level household data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and Statistics Poland. We examine the changes in various indicators of inequality and poverty and their decomposition. All conducted distributional analyses suggest that a decrease in income inequality and poverty reduction is attributable to the program Family 500 + . We assess relative and subjective poverty and show that both are influenced by the program. The causal relationship between the benefit and the decline in child relative and subjective poverty is confirmed by difference-in-differences estimation, in which treated and non-treated households are compared before and after the program’s introduction.}

  abstract = {Background Covid-19 has disrupted the lives of many and resulted in high prevalence rates of mental disorders. Despite a vast amount of research into the social determinants of mental health during Covid-19, little is known about whether the results are consistent with the social gradient in mental health. Here we report a systematic review of studies that investigated how socioeconomic condition (SEC)—a multifaceted construct that measures a person’s socioeconomic standing in society, using indicators such as education and income, predicts emotional health (depression and anxiety) risk during the pandemic. Furthermore, we examined which classes of SEC indicators would best predict symptoms of emotional disorders. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted search over six databases, including Scopus, PubMed, etc., between November 4, 2021 and November 11, 2021 for studies that investigated how SEC indicators predict emotional health risks during Covid-19, after obtaining approval from PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021288508). Using Covidence as the platform, 362 articles (324 cross-sectional/repeated cross-sectional and 38 longitudinal) were included in this review according to the eligibility criteria. We categorized SEC indicators into ‘actual versus perceived’ and ‘static versus fluid’ classes to explore their differential effects on emotional health. Results Out of the 1479 SEC indicators used in these 362 studies, our results showed that 43.68\% of the SEC indicators showed ‘expected’ results (i.e., higher SEC predicting better emotional health outcomes); 51.86\% reported non-significant results and 4.46\% reported the reverse. Economic concerns (67.16\% expected results) and financial strains (64.16\%) emerged as the best predictors while education (26.85\%) and living conditions (30.14\%) were the worst. Conclusions This review summarizes how different SEC indicators influenced emotional health risks across 98 countries, with a total of 5,677,007 participants, ranging from high to low-income countries. Our findings showed that not all SEC indicators were strongly predictive of emotional health risks. In fact, over half of the SEC indicators studied showed a null effect. We found that perceived and fluid SEC indicators, particularly economic concerns and financial strain could best predict depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings have implications for policymakers to further understand how different SEC classes affect mental health during a pandemic in order to tackle associated social issues effectively.}

  abstract = {Research Originality: Human development is a complex issue faced by various countries worldwide. Technology is considered to have the potential to significantly impact the landscape of human development due to its potential for penetration. This research contributes to the development literature in Indonesia by focusing on the important aspects of the influence of socio-economic factors and technological capabilities on the quality of human development.Research Objectives: This research aims to analyse how socio-economic and technological capabilities influence the quality of human development in Indonesia.Research Methods: Using panel data from 34 provinces spanning the period from 2015 to 2022, the research employs a Panel Data Regression Analysis model with the best-fitted Fixed Effect model.Empirical Results: The results of this study indicate that socio-economic factors, as seen through unemployment and poverty, significantly negatively impact Indonesia's Human Development Index (HDI). Economic growth has an insignificant effect on Indonesia's HDI. Technological capabilities, measured through the ICT Development Index, and the proportion of adolescents and adults aged 15-59 with ICT skills, have a significantly positive impact on Indonesia's HDI.Implications: The results of this research identify factors that can either encourage or hinder HDI, offering valuable insights for government policymakers to enhance HDI in Indonesia, particularly in each region.JEL Classification: O15, O30, O47How to Cite:Setyowati, I.
