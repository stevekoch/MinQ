  abstract = {Abstract We investigate the formation of minimum income aspirations in South Africa, a country characterised by high poverty rates and high and rising rates of inequality. Although a few empirical studies have explored income aspirations in South Africa, this is the first study that analyses nationally representative micro-data. We add to the broader empirical literature on income aspirations in two ways. First, we investigate whether there is evidence of aspirations failure among the poor and we test the relationship between aspirations and income inequality. Second, we explore whether aspirations have different associations when social comparisons are drawn with different reference groups. Our analysis of the minimum income question (MIQ) asked in a national household survey from 2008/2009 shows that although aspirations increase significantly with income, the poor are far more likely than the non-poor to report aspirations that exceed current income. The aspirations of both the poor and the non-poor also vary positively (and not negatively) with local levels of inequality, although aspirations respond significantly only to the relative success of others in the same race group.}

  abstract = {This study uses the 2019 Malawi Fifth Integrated Household Survey with 2,688 data to determine poverty factors in Malawi. Households’ subjective assessment of poverty having six levels is used with an ordered-probit model since it can easily catch deprivation in various aspects of people’s lives and complement the income-based poverty measurement for farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, consumption poverty using the annual per capita consumption value is compared with subjective poverty with a multinomial logit model. A partial proportional odds model is used as it rejects the parallel lines assumption. The overall results indicate that subjective and consumption poverty determinants overlap. But subjective poverty is more associated with household assets, natural disasters, aid, financial inclusion, food security, marital status, and education level than consumption poverty in Malawi. Policy support for continuing and developing subsidy programs for food, agricultural input, and life convenience is suggested since ongoing programs equally treat a variety of households and increase possibilities to escape both subjective and consumption poverty. Also, a rural extension program that provides asset management education is expected to draw overall welfare for vulnerable households. Finally, female welfare should be improved by reducing the wage gap and diversifying its welfare programs to improve the social perception of female labor.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION The wealth index is a commonly-used measure of socio-economic position (SEP) in low- and middle-income settings, but there is concern that it is strongly influenced by community-level as well as household-level factors. Subjective SEP indicators are infrequently used in health research.   METHODS We use data from 11 280 households included in the Malawi Integrated Household Survey 2004/5. We compare the wealth index with four subjective measures of SEP: perceived food consumption adequacy, perceived overall consumption adequacy, an economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency. The wealth index is compared with each subjective SEP measure in terms of: (i) agreement of classification of households, (ii) targeting accuracy with respect to US\$1-a-day poverty based on consumption expenditure, and (iii) the socio-economic processes (household- and community-level) giving rise to the SEP scores.   RESULTS Each subjective SEP indicator resulted in considerable differential classification of households compared with the wealth index. Three measures of subjective SEP (perceived food consumption adequacy, economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency) identified a higher proportion of dollar-a-day poor households as poor than the wealth index. The wealth index was strongly influenced by community infrastructure, but all subjective SEP indicators were free from strong community-level influence.   CONCLUSION The strengths and limitations of any measure of SEP depend on the context and purpose for which it is being used. In these data, the wealth index was strongly influenced by community infrastructure, whereas the subjective SEP measures were not, perhaps allowing analyses using them to disentangle household and community influences. Several subjective measures also corresponded to dollar-a-day poverty more strongly than the wealth index. Subjective measures may therefore be preferable to the wealth index in some circumstances, although they have their own set of potential biases.}

We evaluate the various responses of these households to changes in food expenditures, income, and prices, and simulate the welfare losses of food price changes across poverty definitions. We use the QUAIDS model to estimate food elasticities and rely on the National Survey of Expenditure and Household Income, from Uruguay 2016/2017, because it contains novel information on the subjective poverty status of each household. Our results show important differences across poverty definitions. In addition, we find that price increases may lead to larger welfare losses in poor households. On average, the percentage of income needed to avoid a loss in the economic welfare of poor households, defined by the objective method, is twice that required by the non-poor households, for all price changes. Differences are much smaller when using the subjective approach. Our main contribution is the first evidence of consumption behaviour and welfare analysis under different poverty measures. Our findings highlight the need for policies that mitigate the negative effects of price shocks.}

Based on this methodology, we calculate the household-specific, subjective poverty lines. We are able to compare between the results of subjective poverty analysis using several types of subjective welfare questions. Our results show that the aggregate poverty measures derived from consumption adequacy questions accord quite well with the poverty measures based on objective poverty lines. We demonstrate that the subjective welfare analysis can be used in poor developing countries for evaluating socio-economic and distributional impacts of various policy interventions.}

It compares poverty incidence under the subjective and objective approach, finding subjective poverty is larger than objective for all countries. People identified as poor are generally poor by both measures or only subjective poor, although patterns of overlapping differ between countries. It explores the factors associated to considering oneself as poor - being subjectively poor- when the per capita household income is higher than the objective poverty line. Generally, unemployment and informality are associated with higher probability of subjective poverty. Other factors not directly involving income but reflecting high economic security also tend to reduce the probability of feeling poor. Finally, the welfare stigma effect does not seem to hold, at least in terms of subjective poverty. This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.}

Support programs can improve well-being, but they first require identifying who are the households that judge their income is insufficient to meet their basic needs, and what factors are associated with subjective poverty.Design/methodology/approachHouseholds report the income level they judge is sufficient to make ends meet. Then, they are classified as being subjectively poor if their own monetary income is inferior to the level they indicated. Second, the study compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms, the random forest, support vector machines and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, applied to a set of socioeconomic variables to predict subjective poverty status.FindingsThe random forest generates 85.29\% of correct predictions using a range of income and non-income predictors, closely followed by the other two techniques. For the middle-income group, the LASSO regression outperforms random forest. Subjective poverty is mostly associated with monetary income for low-income households. However, a combination of low income, low endowment (land, consumption assets) and unusual large expenditure (medical, gifts) constitutes the key predictors of feeling poor for the middle-income households.Practical implicationsTo reduce the feeling of poverty, policy intervention should continue to focus on increasing incomes. However, improvements in nonincome domains such as health expenditure, education and family demographics can also relieve the feeling of income inadequacy. Methodologically, better performance of either algorithm depends on the data at hand.Originality/valueFor the first time, the authors show that prediction techniques are reliable to identify subjective poverty prevalence, with example from rural China. The analysis offers specific attention to the modest-income households, who may feel poor but not be identified as such by objective poverty lines, and is relevant when policy-makers seek to address the “next step” after ending extreme poverty. Prediction performance and mechanisms for three machine learning algorithms are compared.}

Methods The Addis Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Addis-HDSS), based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, collects data on various socioeconomic indicators, including income, expenditure, and asset ownership. In this study, a single question, “Does your family's income cover basic needs?” was used as a proxy for SES. The percent agreement with the wealth index was calculated, and significance was assessed using the Pearson chi-square test. Scale reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha (α). Results Data from 30,533 households showed strong agreement (α = 0.925) between self-reported income adequacy and wealth for both lower and higher wealth groups. The highest agreement was found between the lowest wealth index and “very low” income adequacy (93.84\%) and between the highest wealth index and “high” income adequacy (89.47\%) (p < 0.001). Conclusion The single-item SES measure showed good agreement with the wealth index in an urban setting. This simple tool can effectively identify vulnerable populations for targeted health interventions. Further research is needed to assess its applicability in other contexts.}

This paper studies the merit of this approach by using survey data of public opinion collected in Hong Kong in 2023. To derive the CSPL, the classic method relies on a log function relating the subjectively perceived income need to actual income to derive the subjective poverty line. We found the CSPL thus derived grossly overstates the poverty rate compared to conventional approaches (e.g., based on relative income). Two alternative consensual-building methods based on weighted averaging and machine learning are considered; while they show some differences, they do not address the basic problem. While the CSPL may not accurately reflect the degree of poverty, the data can be used to identify factors influencing public perceptions of income needs. We demonstrate how this can be done through a preliminary analysis.}

Until recently, most economists have resisted a seemingly obvious solution, namely to ask people themselves:``Do you feel poor?``The paper studies the case for and against this approach. It is argued that, while one would not want to use self-assessments as welfare metrics in their own right, there is scope for using such data to help calibrate multidimensional measures. Indeed, the idea of a``social subjective poverty line``(below which people tend to think they are poor, but above which they do not) is arguably the most conceptually appealing way of defining poverty. However, the paper points to a number of concerns that have received insufficient attention, including the choice of covariates, survey design issues, measurement errors, frame-of-reference effects, and latent heterogeneity in personality traits and personal tradeoffs. Directions for future research are identified.}

Data source and methods: The Foster Greere Thorbecke poverty index by groups and income components using the Shapley Value was used to identify household vulnerability status. A multinomial logit model was used to investigate factors that contribute to vulnerability to poverty. Results: The study findings pointed out that high-income variability contributes to vulnerability and poverty among urban and rural areas. Additionally, the findings of the study demonstrated that only a few households fall in the middle (lower bound) poverty lines. Conclusions: Race and location are strong predictors of poverty in South Africa.}

The implied subjective poverty lines are robust to alternative methods of dealing with other components of consumption, for which the subjective``adequacy``question was not asked.

Contrary to earlier findings on South African data from 1993 and 1998, the results do not provide evidence for the existence of an asset-based poverty trap. Instead, the results seem to indicate the existence of a low-level equilibrium beyond which structural income remains very persistent. The robustness of the results is confirmed by making use of control functions in order to correct for any measurement error which may exist in the data on assets.}

This study focuses on the sources and extent of within-groups (intragroup; blacks African against each other) and between-groups (intergroup; whites, Indians, coloured and black Africans) inequality and poverty which varies more widely today than over the past decade. To achieve this, two harmonised General Household Surveys from 2012 and 2017 were utilised. The study found that poverty was mainly within-groups, yet, inequality was between-groups. Thus, more efforts should be directed in reducing poverty amongst black Africans within sub groups or tribal lines. Furthermore, income sources from agriculture and pension were the more elastic income components, suggesting that any changes in these two has the likelihood of worsening or reducing inequality. The study recommends that the government should focus on ways of boosting agricultural employment and social grants distribution.}

In this paper, the poor are separated from the non-poor by means of an income poverty line and their responsiveness to price changes compared. Of the sampled population, 56\% were found to be poor of which 26\% of the participants were categorised as moderately poor, with 30\% extremely poor.

  abstract = {Introduction Despite a growing interest in the measurement and conceptualization of wellbeing, the integration within sustainability research, and the understanding of how different wellbeing outcomes relate, is limited. Many studies focus on singular, often objectively measured, outcomes, without acknowledging the breadth of available measures. This approach can result in crucial subjective information, which can be explored to understand actors’ behaviors and responses, being omitted from research and policy. This study explores objective and subjective wellbeing outcomes, and how they relate, within an environmentally vulnerable context. Wellbeing and environmental services are intrinsically interlinked, therefore, appropriate policy solutions are required to address human needs and pressures on supporting ecosystems. Methods This paper uses binary logistic regression modelling, and qualitative participatory rural appraisal methods, to understand the environmental conditions, including climatic hazards and landscape characteristics, associated with households experiencing different objective/subjective wellbeing outcomes within Volta Delta, Ghana. Results The mixed method approach highlights a differing relationship between inland agricultural areas impacted by drought and erosion, and coastal/riverine, peri-urban landscapes exposed to flooding and salinization. Agricultural areas associate with “poor but happy” outcomes, whereas peri-urban landscapes associate with being “non-poor but unhappy.” Drawing on existing literature, and both quantitative and qualitative results, these varying outcomes are hypothesized to be driven by differences in livelihood vulnerability, relative comparisons to others, responses to climatic hazards, and individualistic/collective wellbeing conceptualizations. Discussion Our study concludes that environmental conditions influence objective and subjective wellbeing through different mechanisms. Sustainable development research should incorporate both objective and subjective measures when implementing and monitoring policy to more comprehensibly capture, and improve, wellbeing in environmentally vulnerable locations.}

  abstract = {Purpose/objectives: The aim of this paper is to obtain a better understanding of the income and expenditure patterns of selected deep rural villages. This is done by measuring the level of poverty and/or the poverty gap of 132 households in Limpopo, one of the poorest provinces in South Africa. Problem investigated: The Millennium Declaration symbolises the commitment to end extreme poverty, but limited data is available for rural areas to inform policy decisions. The relative income shares for individuals, households and percentile groups within a population provide the best information on poverty for policy formulation. The nature and size distribution of income are therefore central to analysing the poverty problem within low-income areas. The survey area is one of the poorest areas in South Africa, and shows what data is needed to measure and understand the extent of poverty. Design/Method/Approach: A representative sample of 132 households was drawn, which represents 6,9 percent of the estimated 1900 households in selected villages of rural Limpopo. A total of 740 household members were represented in the survey, with an average of 5,6 members per household. Originality/Value: Although this is a relatively small sample, it generated much-needed data on this very poor area of South Africa. Detailed empirical data on the income and expenditure patterns is not available, especially for rural areas. The socio-economic data from this research supported an important health project of the Water and Health Research Unit (WHRU) of the University of Johannesburg. The article also lays the foundation for further research in this field of study, facilitating engagement with a number of related debates such as those about satisfaction of life, vulnerability to poverty, the geography of deprivation and the mapping of poverty. Conclusion: The main finding is that the government provides for many needs of the poor, especially in the deep rural areas. Only 18 percent of the sample households did not receive a state grant in 2007. This was an injection of R88 800 or 33,4 percent of the total income per month, which excludes the social wage in terms of free basic water, electricity, subsidised or free housing, health care subsidies and other support to poor people and rural communities. Of the 485 non-economically active people in the sample, more than 364 or 75 percent receive an income, mainly in the form of state grants. Education suggests itself as a route out of poverty, rather than the child grant and other subsidies that encourage poor people to have more children. Poor couples and single-member households fall through the safety net, because they do not qualify for state grants and have no children yet.}

Results show evidence of upward looking income aspirations for both men and women, and upward looking wealth aspirations only for women, while the social effect of aspirations to children’s education appears to be weak for both sexes. Even though men (in general) appear to have higher aspirations than women, the differences in parameter estimates across gender are not statistically significant, suggesting that the gender-differentiated effect of social drivers on aspirations is limited. The results imply that policies and interventions that raise incomes in the village may increase income aspirations of both men and women, while efforts to enhance women’s wealth aspirations may be more effective if they improve wealth of women in the village. Since our sample is relatively small with limited geographic coverage, findings of this study could be context specific. Hence, further study using more recent and more representative data is necessary to draw fairly generalizable conclusions.}

Analytical techniques utilized include the recent multidimensional poverty index (MPI), descriptive statistics and Tobit regression. Findings reveal that multiple deprivations are found mostly in the rural area of the province; the multidimensional headcount is highest in the rural area, though the intensity of multidimensional poverty is almost similar in both geographical locations. The standard of living dimension is also the largest contribution to MPI in both locations. MPI has significant links with education attainment of household head, access to electricity and asset stock in both geographical locations, but is influenced by the gender of head, agriculture engagement and household monthly income in rural areas only. In order to improve households’ multidimensional poverty status in both urban and rural locations, there is the need to take into account some significant variables such as education of head, increase electricity subsidy coverage during winter period, asset accumulation and increase in households’ participation in agricultural activities, especially those residing in rural areas.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Child neglect is often initially identified via adults who come into contact with children and report their suspicions to the authorities. Little is known about what behaviors laypersons view as constituting neglect and hence worth reporting. We examined laypersons' perceptions of neglect and poverty, particularly how these factors independently and jointly shaped laypersons' decisions about what warrants official reporting of neglect, and how laypersons' socioeconomic background related to their decisions.   HYPOTHESES We anticipated that neglect would be correctly perceived as such, but that extreme poverty would also be perceived as neglect, with these latter perceptions being most pronounced among laypersons of higher socioeconomic background.   METHOD In 2 studies, adults read vignettes about a mother's care of her daughter and rendered decisions about whether the mother's behavior met the legal standard of neglect and should be reported. In Study 1 (N = 365, 55\% female, mean age = 37.12 years), indicators of poverty and neglect were manipulated. In Study 2 (N = 474, 53\% female, mean age = 38.25 years), only poverty (housing instability: homelessness vs. not) was manipulated.   RESULTS Laypersons often conflated poverty and neglect, especially in circumstances of homelessness. Laypersons of lower socioeconomic background were less likely to perceive neglect in general and to report an obligation to make a referral (R2s ranged from 17-26\%, odds ratios ranged from 2.24-3.08).   CONCLUSIONS Laypersons may overreport neglect in circumstances of poverty. Increasing public awareness of how to recognize and separate neglect from poverty may enhance identification of vulnerable children and families.

The majority of impoverished people do not have the means to create increased meaning in their lives, leading to low levels of life satisfaction. This paper investigates the determinants of life satisfaction in a poor community. With nearly half of the South African population living in poverty, the question of which variables predict life satisfaction, with specific reference to poor communities, could be asked. The literature indicates that a number of variables can be predictors of life satisfaction in poor areas. The research methodology includes a quantitative household survey in a traditional poor township in southern Gauteng, namely Sicelo. The satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) was used to determine levels of life satisfaction, and a logistic regression analysis was utilised to determine which variables predict life satisfaction. The results of the research confirm that poor communities have relatively low levels of life satisfaction and that specific variables could predict life satisfaction. The logistic regression analysis indicated variables that predict life satisfaction including income levels, employment status, poverty status and government services amongst others. The implication of the research is that policy formulators should also look at the subjective quality of life indicators when compiling and refining policies. This research provides valuable insights into the predictors of life satisfaction of poor people in a traditional South African township. DOI: 10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n13p163}

  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.21504/10962/59509},
  abstract = {ISER Working Paper No. 2017/3 1 A range of empirical studies have shown that people’s minimum income aspirations increase with their own income (Danziger et al., 1984, de Vos and Garner, 1991, Appadurai, 2004, Stutzer, 2004) and with the income of others in their community (Burchardt, 2005, Barr and Clark, 2010, Knight and Gunatilaka, 2012, Bogliacino and Ortoleva, 2015). These changes have been explained by processes of adaptation through habituation and social comparison (Sen, 1990, Teschl and Comim, 2005, Knight and Gunatilaka, 2012). However, the relationship between aspirations and inequality has received far less empirical attention. There are two competing hypotheses on how inequality shapes individual aspirations. Some studies suggest that high levels of inequality are likely to dampen the aspirations of the relatively poor (Corneo and Jeanne, 2001, Halleröd, 2006, Ray, 2006) because the living standards of the better off may ‘appear as more or less unattainable for people in more straitened economic circumstances’ (Halleröd, 2006: 388). This is described as a failure of the capacity to aspire (Appadurai, 2004). Other studies, however, argue that high and rising levels of inequality may stimulate the aspirations of the relatively poor, if the upward mobility of some is taken as a sign that others may benefit in the future (Stark, 2006, Ray, 2010, Macours and Vakis, 2014). In this paper, we investigate the formation of income aspirations in South Africa, a country with one of the world’s highest levels of inequality. During the decades of apartheid, sharp racial cleavages in access to resources and opportunities meant that high levels of aggregate inequality reflected large racial divisions in income. Over the post-apartheid period, inequality has increased further. However, this increase has been driven by a rise in within-race inequality, and particularly by a widening of inequality among Africans1 who comprise the majority population of South Africa (Leibbrandt et al., 2010). Poverty rates, which have fallen only modestly since the democratic transition, remain high and Africans remain considerably overrepresented among the poor (Leibbrandt et al., 2010, Posel et al., 2016). However, there has also been significant racial transformation at the upper end of the income distribution over the post-apartheid period (Visagie, 2015a, Southall, 2016). We explore the formation of income aspirations in the context of these high levels of both poverty and inequality by analysing responses to the classic minimum income question (MIQ) (see Goedhard et al., 1977) collected in a nationally representative household survey conducted in 2008/2009. Respondents were asked to identify the minimum monthly income needed for their household to make ends meet, a measure viewed as the lower threshold of their income aspirations (Stutzer, 2004, Herrera et al., 2006, Barr and Clark, 2010, Knight and Gunatilaka, 2012). We investigate whether and how the aspirations gap, or the difference between actual income and reported minimum income needs, differs between households that are below and above the national poverty line. We then estimate the correlates of income aspirations in both poor and non-poor households and consider in particular, how aspirations differ according to the average income and inequality levels in the household’s residential district. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we provide a brief review of the literature on aspirations, adaptation and inequality, and of the South African context. In Section 3 we discuss the data that we analyse and outline our empirical strategy. 1 Statistics South Africa uses the categories Black African, Indian/Asian, Coloured and White to represent the four main population groups in all household surveys and in the Census. We follow this approach and, in our analysis, ‘Africans’ refers to the group ‘Black Africans’.}

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reconcile the multidimensional nature of poverty with a population's cultural conditioning for the purpose of policy evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modeling is the strategy used to compare nested models. Findings - The results show that the observed differences in the dimensions of poverty significantly, but not exclusively, result from differences in cultural valuation systems between groups. Culture influences poverty in two ways: differences in perceptions and differences in the poverty determinants. Practical implications - In consideration of these results, we propose a participatory, decentralized and cautious approach in developing credible poverty-alleviation strategies which respond to the needs expressed by the relevant populations. Originality/value - In this research, the authors adopt a quantitative approach which applies some statistical tests to analyze the effects of cultural values on poverty.}

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for defining an international poverty line based on explicit budgeting. The novel feature is that linear programming is used to deduce the diet that minimizes cost and guarantees survival. Nonfood items are also explicitly budgeted and amount to about one quarter of the cost of subsistence. A series of least cost diets are calculated with increasingly demanding nutritional requirements for twenty countries using prices from ICP 2011. The aim is to see which requirements rationalize the spending pattern of the poor. The ‘reduced basic’ model does the job. When the cost of the nonfood items are added to the cost of the ‘reduced basic’ diet, the resulting Linear Programming Poverty Line (LPPL) averages \$1.88 per day across the poor countries in the sample. The same model rationalizes both the spending pattern of the poor and the World Bank Poverty Line. The LPPL has the advantages that it is (1) clearly related to survival and well being, (2) comparable across time and space since the same nutritional requirements are used everywhere, (3) adjusts consumption patterns to local prices, (4) presents no index number problems since solutions are always in local prices, and (5) requires only readily available information, namely, the prices in ICP or equivalent.}

Subjective well-being and aspirations are measured using the South African Social Attitudes Study of 2006, a year characterised by a peak in post-apartheid economic growth and inequality. Inequality and connectedness are found to play decisive roles in experiences of social comparison and relative deprivation. Income growth paths that contribute to higher inequality and/or lower connectedness are related to narrower aspirations gaps and aspirations failure amongst the objectively poor, whilst also widening the aspirations gaps of those engaged in upward social comparisons. Conversely, inequality tied to greater connectedness inspires aspirations, although not beyond a level that could potentially frustrate. This has implications for subjective well-being, indicated to decrease significantly with aspirations gaps.}

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the food consumption patterns of poor and non-poor rural households in Eswatini using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model to derive the estimates of price and expenditure elasticities for seven major food commodities. The derived elasticities are used in estimating the distributional welfare effects of a 43\% price increase for maize using the compensating variation approach. The results of the study indicate that majority of the food items are demand inelastic with meat and dairy exhibiting elasticities greater than one, while maize is the least responsive to both price and expenditure. The results further show that high maize prices have a negative effect on poor households who generally spend more on maize to supplement their consumption requirements. Therefore, policy strategies that focus on expanding agricultural production and diversification of production activities especially at the household level can raise rural household income, lower the price of maize and ultimately improve food consumption for rural households. Moreover, this will insure net-buying households against market risks by lowering high reliance on the market and enable more consumption from own production. This study makes an important empirical contribution by providing useful insights on the estimates of demand elasticities for major food items consumed, taking into account that little attention has been devoted to empirical analysis of food consumption behavior in Eswatini.}

Findings include that having a better rule of law and fiscal performance, reducing political fragmentation to have better governance, guaranteeing property rights, fostering the benefits of metropolitan areas, and improving citizen participation reduce the probability of feeling poor.}

Methods Perinatal women, attending 14 healthcare facilities in Cape Town, were enrolled in the study during baseline data collection before the COVID-19 lockdown. During the lockdown period, fieldworkers telephonically contacted the perinatal women who were enrolled in the study and had provided contact details. The following data were collected from those who consented to the study: socio-demographic information, mental health assessment, food insecurity status and experiences of domestic violence. Poisson regression was used to model the associations of a number of risk factors with the occurrence of CMDs. Results Of the 2149 women enrolled in the ASSET study, 885 consented to telephonic interviews. We found that 12.5\% of women had probable CMDs and 43\% were severely food insecure. Psychological distress increased significantly during the lockdown period, compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. Using multivariate Poisson regression modelling, we showed that the risk of CMDs was increased in women who were severely food insecure or who experienced psychological or sexual abuse. Conclusions This study provides evidence of the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status of perinatal women living in low-resource settings in Cape Town and highlights how a crisis such as the COVID-19 lockdown amplifies the psycho-social risk factors associated with CMDs in perinatal women.}

The specific objectives were to determine the poverty status of the households and, investigate the influence of asset ownership and income on household poverty in South Africa. Secondary data was sourced from the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) 2014/2015 data. A sample size of 9619 households was selected for this study. The poverty status of the households was determined using the poverty line. The poverty line was calculated as two-third of the mean-per-capita household expenditure. Households with expenditure above the poverty line were considered to be ``non-poor`` and those with expenditure below the poverty line were considered ``poor``. For the purpose of this study, assets were divided into monetary and non-monetary assets. Binary logistic technique was further used to analyse the influence of ownership of monetary and non-monetary assets, household income, household size (as a control variable), and provincial locations on the household poverty status. An investigation into the assets owned by households indicated that real estate assets, business assets, vehicle assets, financial assets, superannuation assets, livestock assets and possessions, were assets owned by South African households. The results showed that 59.49\% of South African households experience poverty, particularly in Kwazulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Limpopo provinces. The results of the logistic regression further revealed that ownership of non-monetary assets, income and household size had a positive influence on the household poverty status. The Western Cape, Northern Cape, Free State, and Gauteng provinces had high probability for improving the household poverty status, while Kwazulu-Natal province showed a negative influence on the poverty status. It was recommended that policies should focus on income redistribution through employment generation, which will lead to enhanced income. This can, in turn, be used to acquire assets, especially in the most affected provinces like Kwazulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Limpopo province.}

Even so, PPP comparisons between widely different countries rest on weak theoretical and foundations. I argue for wider use of self-reports from international monitoring surveys, and for a global poverty line that is truly denominated in US dollars.}

For that reason, South Africa integrated policies and strategies to rid poverty by half to that of United Nations (UN). Through all the combined policy approaches, South Africa has successfully achieved the target of halving the population living below PPP\$1.25c per person per day. Whichever threshold used, the results showed that the percentage share of people living below poverty line has now decreased from 11.3 per cent in 2000 to 4.0 per cent in 2011. However, these reports are not reflecting the exact poor’s experiences because at household level there is still an outright poverty. Therefore, if the national poverty report gives a good picture about South African poverty status whereas there is still prevalence of poverty at household level, there are high chances that wrong policies in regard to poverty reduction strategies will be wrought. Hence this paper focuses on the determinants of household poverty in South Africa. The sole aim of this paper is to assess the determinants of household poverty in South Africa. The reviewed literature on determinants of poverty in South Africa would enable policy makers to see the effect of demographic characteristics on poverty in South Africa. Thus, strategies and policies aimed at alleviating poverty in South Africa can be directed to the discussed factors.}

A context-specific poverty line would be more consistent with preferences. This paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence that the contrary holds and that the national poverty line is more appropriate for comparing living standards among the poor, at least under prevailing conditions in Mozambique and Ghana. The problem lies in the risk of downscaling the burden associated with cheap-calorie diets and the low nonfood component of the rural poor. The paper illustrates how observed behavior may neither reveal preferences nor detect heterogeneous preferences among the poor. Rather, the consumption pattern is the upshot of the poverty condition itself. Poverty is confused with preferences if observed cheap-calorie diets are seen as a matter of taste, whereas in fact they reflect a lack of means to consume a preferred diet of higher quality, as food Engel curve estimates indicate. Likewise, a smaller nonfood component is not a matter of a particular distaste, but an adaptation to the fact that various nonfood items (such as transport) and basic services (such as electricity and health) are simply absent in rural areas.}

The global poverty number is estimated by the World Bank as a worldwide count of people who live below a common international poverty line. This line, loosely referred to as the dollar-a-day line, is calculated as an average over the world’s poorest countries of their national poverty lines expressed in international dollars. The average is then converted back to local currency to calculate each country’s counts of those living below the line. The counts come from household surveys, the number and coverage of which have steadily increased over the years. The conversion of national poverty lines to international currency and the conversion of the global line back to local currency are both done using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates from the various rounds of the International Comparison Program (ICP). These PPPs, unlike market exchange rates, are constructed as multilateral price indexes using directly observed consumer prices in many countries. This paper is about the construction of the PPPs and their effect on the poverty estimates. In the first dollar-a-day poverty calculations, the World Bank (1990) used price indexes for GDP, but this practice was later improved by the use of price indexes for household consumption. Yet even this may be misleading if the price indexes for national aggregate consumption are different from those relevant for people who live at or around the global poverty line. Price indexes are weighted averages}

Given the poor performance of the South African economy, including declining per capita incomes and increasing unemployment, since 2010 or so, it is important to examine poverty dynamics in the recent years. Many recent studies in this regard have relied on 2015 data, and do not examine all the three interrelated aspects of wellbeing viz. poverty, human development and inequality. In this context, this paper uses all the five waves of the National Income Dynamics Study and employs different poverty and inequality measurement techniques to investigate poverty dynamics, human development and inequality during the post-apartheid period in South Africa. The estimates suggest that although poverty was declining prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the African/Black population group is the most affected by poverty. The phenomenon of feminisation of poverty is also verified based on the evidence of increasingly more women in poverty than men. The proportion of population experiencing multiple deprivations, measured by the Multidimensional Poverty Index, have not changed in the post-apartheid period. Similarly, human development has not improved during this period. South African society continues to be one of the most unequal societies in the world. The paper argues that the inability to sufficiently reduce poverty, unemployment and inequality results from the weak performance of the South African economy. In the same vein, it is the structure of the South African economy that has kept the levels of human development low and income inequality high.}

The paper also investigates patterns of and trends in poverty and income distribution, a literature with a long and distinguished history. Drawing from recent literature in this regard, the paper shows that the labour market – rather than access to wealth or to political and fiscal power – currently sets the limits to redistribution. Wage inequality, deeply rooted in South Africa’s history, plays a central role in overall income distribution, and patterns of human capital development are fundamental to the future growth path and therefore to poverty and income distribution. The paper therefore concludes that reducing inequality substantially is currently unlikely without a massive increase in the human capital of those presently poor, but that prospects in this regard are inauspicious.}

Physical capital and social capital have the greatest effects on the occurrence of subjective poverty. The probability of subjective poverty decreases by 0.149 and 0.107 for each unit change in physical and social capital, respectively. What’s more, public services supply, physical capital, financial capital, and human capital affect the subjective poverty of urban and rural residents at different significance levels.

However, if the aim of studying poverty is not only improving the well-being of households who are currently poor, but also preventing people from becoming poor in the future, a new forward looking perspective must be adopted. For thinking about appropriate forward-looking anti-poverty interventions (i.e. interventions that aim to prevent or reduce future poverty rather than alleviate current poverty), the critical need then is to go beyond a cataloging of who is currently poor and who is not, to an assessment of households’ vulnerability to poverty. This study analyses a panel dataset on a representative sample of 150 rural households interviewed in 2007 and 2008 in the Amathole District Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province to empirical assess the dynamics of poverty and estimate the determinants of households’ vulnerability to poverty. The result of the study indicates that the number of vulnerable households is significantly larger than for the currently poor households; the vulnerability index was found to be 0,62 compared to 0,56 headcount index in 2008. This implies that while 56 percent of the sampled households are poor (ex post) in 2008, 62 percent are vulnerable to becoming poor (ex ante) in future. The result of the Probit model shows that the age, level of education and occupation of the household head, dependency ratio, exposure to idiosyncratic risks and access to credit are statistically significant in explaining a households’ vulnerability to poverty.}

  abstract = {When measuring poverty in South Africa, much of the theoretical and empirical work has focused on money-metric measures of poverty. The conventional approach has been the use of a poverty line sufficient to meet primary human needs, often derived from consumption, expenditure or income levels. This narrow perspective has tended to divert the attention of development economists towards the pursuit of income growth, which has been associated with development and a necessary condition for poverty reduction. However, with a changing emphasis on development, the model, analytical methods, and related frameworks have been subjected to critical scrutiny by populists and neoliberals alike. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the existing literature by using an alternative approach ─ a non-monetary approach to the measurement of poverty in South Africa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in South Africa to compute an asset poverty index using principal component analysis in a panel setting and use appropriate panel data models to investigate the key determinants of asset poverty. We used data drawn from the existing five waves of the National Income Dynamic Study. Using the random effect probit model, we found that some factors, such as levels of education of the head of household (primary, secondary, matric and tertiary) and land ownership, have a reducing influence on asset poverty. Factors The results also revealed that household size and unemployed people are more prone in South Africa.}

This objective is in line with the first Sustainable Development Goal, which seeks to eliminate global poverty in all its forms by 2030. This study aims to explore the factors that contribute to asset poverty in South Africa, both urban and rural, an issue that data constraints have largely overlooked. This work utilises principal component analysis to calculate weights and appropriate panel data models to identify essential drivers of asset poverty within distinct geographical areas in South Africa. The findings from the random effect probit model revealed that variables such as land ownership, age of the head of the household, being married, and educational status have a significant mitigating impact on asset poverty. However, the factors contributing to rural asset poverty differ somewhat from those contributing to urban asset poverty. For instance, land ownership appears to be a key factor in explaining poverty in rural areas, relative to their urban areas. Additionally, we found that being married and having all levels of education are key predictors of the rural sample based on the magnitudes of the impact. These findings imply that land remains a fundamental component of different livelihoods for rural dwellers and might encourage rural, emerging agriculturalists to participate in large-scale farming. Thus, the government should continue to redistribute land and further assist rural emerging agriculturalists who want to be involved in large-scale farming.}

What accounts for these huge differences, and can they be understood within a common global definition of poverty? For all except the poorest countries, the absolute, nutrition-based, poverty lines found in practice tend to behave more like relative lines, in that they are higher for richer countries. Prevailing methods of setting absolute lines allow ample scope for such relativity, even when nutritional norms are common across countries. Both macro data on poverty lines across the world and micro data on subjective perceptions of poverty are consistent with a weak form of relativity that combines absolute consumption needs with social-inclusion needs that are positive for the poorest but rise with a countrys mean consumption. The strong form of relativism favored by some developed countries -- whereby the line is set at a fixed proportion of the mean -- emerges as the limiting case for very rich countries.}

  abstract = {Numerous households in developing and emerging countries suffer the indignities of poverty, South Africa is no exception. Approximately half of South Africa?s populace is deemed chronically poor at the upper-bound national poverty line of R1183 (in 2018 prices) per individual monthly. Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, thus a consequence of a number of interactive socioeconomic aspects. Literature proposes that head of household characteristics determine, to a certain extent, the capacity of a household to earn a given level of income to meet the household?s material and non-material needs. The primary objective of this study was to provide a South African perspective of the antecedents of the nexus between household characteristics and poverty. Poverty is thus examined at micro level by analysing head of household characteristics such as age, gender, level of education, employment status, income, geographical location, size of the household etcetera. In so doing, this paper used primary data obtained through the latest General Household Survey conducted (GHS) in 2018 by Statistics South Africa with a sample of 72 291 respondents. The following statistical methods were employed; descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, Logistic regression analysis and cross tabulations in order to determine the impact of the selected micro level variables on household poverty. The estimation results show that the level of education of the head of household, gender and geographical location, have substantial impacts on the poverty status and living standard of the respective household. There is a positive correlation between poverty and education attainment, the higher the level of education, the lower the predominance of poverty. A large household size intensifies the probability of poverty in the household. Compared to their female counterparts, male headed households are reportedly less likely to live in poverty. Capturing poverty at macro level provides a national perspective of poverty, however from a micro level perspective one can expect to get the effect of the internal household characteristics on poverty thereby providing policies and strategies in line with alleviating poverty at both household and national level. For future research, it would be interesting to conduct a comparative study, analysing poverty at both household and national level.}

To explore these ideas, this paper employs a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Novel econometric analysis of asset dynamics over the 1993–98 period identifies a dynamic asset poverty threshold that signals that large numbers of South Africans are indeed trapped without a pathway out of poverty. Qualitative analysis of this period and the period 1998–2001 more deeply examines patterns of mobility, and confirms the continuation of this pattern of limited upward mobility and a low-level poverty trap. In addition, the qualitative data permit a closer look at the specific role played by social relationships. While finding ample evidence of active social capital and networks, these are more helpful for non-poor households. For the poor, social capital at best helps stabilise livelihoods at low levels and does little to promote upward mobility. While there is thus some economic sense to sociability in South Africa, elimination of the polarised economic legacy of apartheid will ultimately require more proactive efforts to assure that households have access to a minimum bundle of assets and to the markets needed to effectively build on those assets over time.}

  journal = {Unknown Journal},
  year = {2009},
  doi = {10.17037/PUBS.00768490},
  abstract = {Background  The wealth index is a commonly-used measure of socio-economic position (SEP) in  low- and middle-income countries. The approach arose from Demographic and  Health Surveys (DHS) where few other options for SEP-measurement are available.  Despite many unanswered questions the wealth index approach, and the methods of  wealth index construction used by the DHS, have been widely-adopted by the  epidemiological community. This thesis explores the appropriateness of the wealth  index as a measure of SEP, using data from the Malawi Integrated Household Survey  2004/5 (IHS2) and Brazil DHS 1996.  Main findings  1) The wealth index and consumption expenditure  Some proponents of the wealth index claim it to be a reliable and rational proxy for  consumption expenditure; a systematic review of the literature demonstrated this to  be an unreasonable assumption. Analyses of IHS2 data showed that the agreement  of the wealth index with consumption expenditure is largely unaffected by alternative  equivalence scales for adjusting consumption expenditure for household size and  composition, or by the range of items included in the consumption expenditure  aggregate.  2) Are the methods of wealth index construction used by the DHS the most  appropriate?  The DHS use principal components analysis (PCA) to weight the indicators in a  wealth index; issues in the use of PCA were considered and alternative weighting  methods explored. When nominal or ordered categorical indicators are used,  alternatives to PCA are considered preferable. A single wealth index is often  constructed for urban and rural areas together; generating separate indices for each  area had little effect on the final index. Agreement with consumption expenditure  was lower in rural areas; various approaches to wealth index construction did not  alter this. Expanding the range and number of indicators used by DHS wealth  indices did not increase agreement with consumption expenditure, but it did reduce  2  the observed urban-rural differences and enhance the ability of the wealth index to  differentiate between rural households.  3) What socio-economic processes contribute to the wealth index hierarchy?  A key issue for any measure of SEP is its conceptual clarity; analyses of the IHS2  data demonstrate that the socio-economic processes leading to a wealth index  hierarchy remain largely unknown, although both household- and community-level  factors play a role.  4) Alternatives to the wealth index  Potential alternatives to the wealth index were explored, and the consequences of  using the wealth index versus these alternatives were assessed for different purposes.  The uncertainty about the socio-economic processes being captured by the wealth  index implies that in all situations, the wealth index should only be used after careful  consideration of available alternative SEP indicators.  Conclusions  Using the wealth index in the DHS has allowed the quantification and comparison of  health inequalities in low- and middle-income countries on an unprecedented scale,  thereby playing a vital role in advocacy of health equity. Some alterations to the  methodology of wealth index construction are recommended for future studies using  the wealth index, but the use of the wealth index in primary data collection is  questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the socio-economic processes it is  capturing.}

As such, its measurement may entail and benefit from the combination of both “qualitative-subjective” and “quantitative-objective” indicators. Yet, the evidence on the external validity of subjective-type information is scarce, especially using representative household surveys. The aim of this paper is to compare information on self-perceived food consumption adequacy from the subjective modules of household surveys with standard quantitative indicators, namely calorie consumption, dietary diversity and anthropometry. Datasets from four countries are analyzed: Albania, Madagascar, Nepal and Indonesia. Simple descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, contingency tables and multivariate regression show that the “subjective” indicator is at best poorly correlated with standard quantitative indicators. The paper concludes that while subjective food adequacy indicators may provide insight on the vulnerability dimension of food insecurity, they are too blunt an indicator for food insecurity targeting. An effort towards developing improved subjective food security modules that are contextually sensitive should go hand in hand with research into how to improve household survey data for food security measurement along other dimensions of the phenomenon, particularly calorie consumption.}

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Poverty, despite being a multifaceted concept, is commonly measured in either absolute or relative monetary terms. However, it can also be measured subjectively, as people form perceptions on their relative income, welfare, and life satisfaction. Poverty measurement based on objective indicators such as official poverty lines is often used to orient and prioritize policy actions. However, such ‘standard’ poverty measures based on household consumption or income aggregates have several shortcomings. This objective indicator does little to inform policy makers about public preferences. The main goal of this paper is to investigate multifaceted poverty measurement by combining objective and subjective measures to provide useful insights into poverty in Malaysia. In addition, this study explored the multifaceted poverty incidence among the low-income household from the perspective of zakat applicants.     Methodology: Data was collected using a survey and interviews of zakat applicants under the category of poor and needy in the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRC) of Melaka, one of the states in Malaysia. Three poverty measurements, i.e., Poverty Line Income (PLI), Haddul Kifayah and Subjective Poverty Index (SPI), are utilized in this study.  Findings: The PLI and Haddul Kifayah are categorized as objective poverty measures, while SPI is categorized as a subjective poverty measure. The different measures of poverty would produce different analytical results that, in turn, call for a different set of policy interventions.     Contributions: These findings point to the needs of tailor-made strategies for the society to cope with multifaceted poverty.     Keywords: Multifaceted poverty, objective poverty, subjective poverty, poverty measurement, zakat recipients.     Cite as: Othman, A., Mohd Noor, A.

  abstract = {This paper compares a standard expenditure-based poverty measure with a specifically created composite measure of deprivation using household survey data from South Africa while there is a strong overall correlation between expenditures and levels of deprivation, the correlation is much weaker among the worst-off South Africans. In addition, the two measures differ considerably in the impact of race, headship, location (urban, rural), and household size on expenditure poverty versus deprivation. In general, the deprivation measure finds more Africans, rural dwellers, members of de facto female-headed households, and members of smaller households deprived than expenditure poor. Only the differences in the effect of household size on poverty are sensitive to assumptions about equivalence scales. As a result, the two measures diverge greatly in identifying the poorest and most deprived sections of the population, which may have considerable consequences for targeting.

Results present evidence that income significantly inspires one's aspirations, and all conclusions still hold after overcoming the interference of potential endogenous issues. In terms of channels, the “aspirations window” (a set of similar perceivable individuals) and “bandwidth load” (the mental space to think, process problems, and come up with solutions) play the mediating role in the stimulation of money; that is, low incomes will make aspirations window narrower and bandwidth load heavier, which is a momentous force behind one's aspirations failure. This paper also enlightens income distribution and the construction of internal motivation mechanisms.}

In this study, the Alkire-Foster method was applied to examine multidimensional poverty in Hong Kong using a random sample of 1,476 Hong Kong adults in a cross-sectional population study undertaken in 2016–2017. Multidimensional poverty was measured on seven dimensions: education, health, mental health, housing, employment, social network, and subjective poverty. The adjusted headcount ratio gradually decreased, and the poverty intensity climbed while the cut-off value of multidimensional poverty increased. Education, employment and subjective poverty made the greatest contribution to multidimensional poverty. Logistic regressions were used to investigate the groups at risk of multidimensional poverty with different deprivation thresholds. Study results show that being female, single, older, a low income and deprived of necessities were risk factors of multidimensional poverty with various poverty cut-offs. Low income and deprivation of necessities correlated but did not overlap with multidimensional poverty. Our findings imply that poverty measurement should be multidimensional, and anti-poverty policy should be more targeted and diversified according to different groups’ risks of multidimensional poverty. The implications of these results and limitations are discussed.}

We estimate poverty using a subjective approach, where the level of the poverty line is derived using the opinion of the individual, rich or poor, on poverty. This approach differs from the objective approach to poverty, which defines poverty according to the opinion of experts. Three subjective poverty lines are presented: one the Financial Satisfaction Poverty Line, two the Leyden Poverty Line, and three the Subjective Well-Being Poverty Line. The first two poverty lines are based on subjective questions regarding income and economic welfare while the last concept focuses on satisfaction with life as a whole. The results obtained are compared with each other and with results derived using ’objective’ measures and official figures.}

Estimates derived from individual income data tend to be higher and have greater variation than those obtained from the household module. This difference between income estimates has a material impact on the secondary analysis of income data. The Gini coefficient, a simple measure of income-inequality, is used in this study to illustrate how household income measured at the household level underestimates household income inequality.}

Ante ello, el principal hallazgo de las metodologias subjetivas en el campo es que los pobres tienden a considerarse ``mas pobres`` de lo que las medidas objetivas sugieren. En este contexto, el presente estudio plantea que mediante la introduccion de consideraciones subjetivas en la medicion de la pobreza, es posible enfrentar tales deficiencias. Sin embargo, medir la pobreza unicamente a partir del reporte de los agentes presenta algunos problemas de confiabilidad, dada la falta de mecanismos para la correcta revelacion de informacion y el condicionamiento de las respuestas a factores animicos. Por ello, la metodologia expuesta, lejos de concentrarse en las respuestas de los agentes al definirlos como pobres, esboza una situacion intermedia: contrasta la percepcion de la pobreza con caracteristicas socioeconomicas y sociodemograficas objetivas. Aplicando estos aspectos a la encuesta HOPE (Hogares de Pobreza Extrema), este estudio se centra en tres ejes fundamentales: evaluar la autopercepcion de la pobreza a partir de condicionantes objetivos, calcular una Linea de Pobreza Subjetiva y analiazar sus implicancias de politica. La importancia de desarrollar este estudio en el Peru es introducir la posibilidad de preguntarle a los pobres como se sienten, ejercicio que es potencialmente util para redefinir la estrategia de lucha contra la pobreza.}

They propose a panel data model to high-quality panel data for Russia for 1994-96, they find that some results widely reported in past studies of subjective well-being appear to be robust but others do not. Household income, for example, is a highly significant predictor of self-rated economic welfare; per capita income is a weaker predictor. Ill health and loss of a job reduce self-reported economic welfare; per capita income is a weaker predictor. Ill health and loss of a job reduce self-reported economic welfare, but demographic effects are weak at a given current income. And the effects of unemployment is not robust. Returning to work does not restore a sense of welfare unless there is an income gain. The results imply that even transient unemployment brings the feeling of a permanent welfare loss, suggesting that high unemployment benefits do not attract people out of work but do discourage a return to work.}

The differentiated impact of shocks on prices on economic well-being and the poverty rate is evaluated, considering variations among households and across five major regions. Methodology: using Deaton’s (1988) unit values model and the 2018 National Income and Expenditure Survey (ENIGH), we calculate price and income elasticities, examining the impact of price variations on income and poverty. Results: our results reveal significant regional differences, emphasizing the need to consider socioeconomic and regional variations and to adopt a territorial approach in such analyses for effective policy formulation. Limitations: there are limitations to this study that may affect a complete understanding of poverty dynamics. We have focused our attention solely on food products, excluding a specific group of products, in this case, fisher y products. We also assume that households are only consumers of goods, thus omitting the productive and self-consumption dimension. Originality: lies in the direct link between poverty estimates and territorial disaggregation, integrating consumption patterns and specific elasticities for each region. Conclusions: our study highlights the importance of considering socioeconomic and regional differences when analyzing the demand for food products and its impact on poverty. Despite the limitations, our findings underscore the need for a territorial approach in this type of analysis to formulate tailored and effective poverty reduction policies in different regions of the country.}

National data from both countries in the early 1980s are analyzed. In regressions of reported minimum income, corrections are made for the omission of income components and selective non‐response. For the first time the relationship between fixed expenditures and the MIQ is examined. Factors significantly related to reported minimum income include household income, household composition, age, education, sex, region, fixed expenditures, and whether the household experienced recent income changes. The income elasticity appears to be smaller in the U.S. than in the Netherlands, while the effects of other socioeconomic factors are greater. On average, the resulting subjective income thresholds are above official poverty lines, but more so in the U.S. than in the Nerherlands. Whether thresholds based on answers to MIQs should be regarded as poverty lines remains open to question.}

Most of the studies followed the income/expenditure approach, which Cheli (1995) regards as the traditional approach to poverty measurement. In defining. the poor, Sen (1976) considers a community S of n people. Then, the set of people with income/expenditure no higher than x is called S(x). If z is “the poverty line”, S(z) is the set of “the poor”. However, Cheli (1995) argues that the division of the population into poor and nonpoor is only to oversimplify reality. Hence this paper uses both traditional approach to the measurement of poverty and the Totally Fuzzy and Relative (TFR) approach. The study is based on the October Household Survey (OHS) conducted by Statistics South Africa in1995.}

  abstract = {South Africa has rolled out several social protection programmes targeted at various categories of people, including children, the elderly, the disabled, and the unemployed. Migrants also access social assistance as a livelihood mechanism. However, while existing studies link the country’s social protection initiatives with reductions in poverty, inequality, and unemployment, much of the data used to back these claims are drawn from quantitative surveys that rarely incorporate the livelihood plight of migrants. This has enormous policy and practical implications. This article seeks to close this gap by examining the role of social grants in migrants’ livelihoods in Cape Town, South Africa. Underpinned by exploratory and descriptive research designs, this mixed research methods study used primary data drawn from migrant household heads receiving social grants and key informants from migrant-serving organisations and focus group discussions. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for quantitative data, while thematic data analysis was used for qualitative data. The results showed that besides the traditional short-term protective role of consumptive expenditure, social grants play a long-term promotive role in facilitating access to education and health and improving access to accommodation, water, and energy for migrants. To maximise social grants’ protective and promotive roles in migrant communities, this article recommends deploying proactive steps, including raising the value of grants, providing financial literacy training, and combining social grants with other programmes. The study adds to ongoing debates on the quality and effectiveness of social protection strategies in South Africa. It also flags policy directions for policymakers and other stakeholders working on social protection in South Africa.

  abstract = {South Africa faces many socio-economic challenges, which include sluggish economic growth, increasing unemployment rates, increasing inequality, and  high  poverty levels., This paper focused on examining how spatial inequality causes these socio-economic issues. The main thrust of the paper is to briefly investigate two major aspects, firstly the root cause of spatial inequality in South Africa, and secondly the impact that spatial inequality has on socio-economic indicators such as economic inequality, poverty, and employment levels. This research used a mixed methodology approach. Empirical research findings proved that apartheid policies contributed to high levels of poverty and inequality in South Africa. As the empirical results show, the existing inequalities in South Africa are predominantly based on a racial sub-group basis, which confirms the causal relationship with historic apartheid spatial policies enforced on a racial basis. Primary research findings depicted that the post-apartheid era is characterised by high poverty levels and huge inequality with the bulk of blacks exposed to diverse macro-economic challenges.  Policy recommendation-wise, it was suggested that the government should continue to redress the systems of apartheid and use policies that help to eradicate poverty.}

  abstract = {Objectives: This study marks a departure from conventional research that predominantly focuses on AI's impact on economic growth. Instead, it uniquely centers on the interplay among fiscal policy, AI investment, monetary policy, and poverty alleviation in South Africa, a nation recognized for its extreme income inequality. In doing so, this research distinguishes itself from the prevailing macro-level studies by scrutinizing the intricate relationship between artificial intelligence, poverty, monetary policy, and fiscal policy, particularly within the South African context. Methods/Approach: It employs the Praise-Winsten model and other econometrics diagnostics for the empirical analysis. Results: The findings reveal that government expenditure on education and investments in artificial intelligence only stimulate household consumption and, therefore, reduce poverty when they are interacted. A one-unit rise in the interaction term increases household consumption by 0.031. Additionally, a unit increase in government national expenditure and broad money growth results in a 0.007 and 0.014 decrease in poverty, respectively. Similarly, gross capital formation positively affects household consumption, thereby reducing poverty in the country by 1.022 due to a one-point increase. In general, taxes on goods and services and the repo rates exert a non-statistically significant effect on the level of poverty in the country .}

  abstract = {  The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant income loss for many people and deepened poverty for individuals and vulnerable populations who were adversely affected through job losses. In South Africa, income loss made it harder to acquire health care and a healthy food, which had a negative impact on health outcomes. This study hypothesised that the COVID-19 shocks disproportionately affects the poor's health, hence the need to know the impact of social protection programmes and interventions through the South Africa Social Security Grant (SASSG). Herewith, we employed the nationally represented, robust and reliable National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) data set which was conducted in 2017 (pre-COVID-19), with the first wave of the NIDS-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) conducted in 2021 (during COVID-19). The household's per capita total income was used to generate poverty lines, while concentration curves and indices were employed to explain the income-health inequalities. The difference-in-difference with fixed effects model was used to estimate the impact of SASSG on the COVID-19 poverty stressors and self-reported health status. Given the significance and magnitude of institutional variables in determining the socio-economic inequalities in poor health, addressing hunger, income inequality and unemployment slightly helped to mitigate income-health inequalities during the COVID-19 shocks. We found that the social protection intervention in South Africa (SASSG) cushioned the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of poverty stressors and self-reported health status. Therefore, we advocate for programmes in South Africa that focus on reducing poverty and health disparities connected to income, as well as more proactive social protection programmes.}

A multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI) was constructed using a generalised structural equation modelling approach to measure the effect of energy poverty on well-being. We found that that higher levels of energy poverty, measured objectively as an MEPI, or subjectively as energy satisfaction, affected well-being negatively, while higher levels of social capital increased well-being. However, the effects varied by household income: MEPI only had a negative effect on well-being for low-income household respondents, and subjective energy poverty only had a negative effect on low-income and middle-income household respondents. Similarly, social capital’s impact varied by household income: for both groups, the strongest source of higher well-being was a sense of belonging, whereas the impact of political trust was stronger for higher-income groups. The findings suggest that policies which decrease energy poverty would improve well-being, but should take into account specific household and community characteristics. Further, fostering neighbourhood social capital is essential, especially for the poorest of the poor.}

Financial inclusion was captured by credit, savings, and insurance whereas multiple correspondence analysis was employed to compute an asset index that captured indicators of individual material possessions. Results from the partial least squares path model suggested that financial inclusion had an indirect positive association with consumers' SWB through increased asset holding, but the association was more pronounced via formal channels of saving, credit, and insurance. As such, social policymakers are encouraged to integrate access to insurance, credit, and savings through formal channels in poverty interventions since this has a greater indirect association with consumers' SWB via increased asset ownership.}

The main objective of this study is to establish whether South Africa can harness remittance inflows to alleviate poverty. Two poverty proxies, namely household consumption expenditure and infant mortality rate, are used in this study. To ensure robustness of the results, both income and non-income proxies of poverty are employed. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds approach, the study found that remittance has a negative impact on poverty in the short run and in the long run when household consumption expenditure is used as a proxy for poverty. However, when the infant mortality rate is used as a proxy, remittance is found to have no impact on poverty. It can be concluded that the impact of remittance on poverty is sensitive to the proxy used. The study concludes that South Africa could benefit immensely from some forms of remittances in its quest to poverty alleviation.}

  abstract = {Background South Africa has a dual system of healthcare model differentiated across socio-economic lines. While on the one hand there exists high quality private facilities that is expensive and accessible to the minority, on the other is the free but stretched and over-crowded public healthcare that the rest of the population relies on. Accessing private facilities requires private medical insurance or requires coping strategies that can lead to household vulnerability. Objective The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between health shocks and household vulnerability in the South African context of high poverty and low medical insurance penetration rate. Data The study employs data from waves three to five of South Africa’s nationally representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) conducted between the period 2012–2017 in approximately two-year intervals. Methods Using food expenditure shock as an indicator for vulnerability, the study utilises a range of econometric techniques from panel logit regression to quasi-experimental design based difference in difference regressions to assess the association between health shocks, medical insurance and household vulnerability. Findings The main finding of the study is that a significant proportion of households in the upper income quintile utilise private healthcare even when not covered by private medical insurance. This preference for private over public health facilities make them vulnerable to health shocks as they cope by sacrificing food consumption to incur additional health expenditure. In contrast, lower income households that are unable to access the high-cost private healthcare tend to rely on the strained public healthcare system. They are not able to use their constrained food expenditure as a coping strategy for private or out-of-pocket medical expenses because their food consumption is already at a bare minimum. Conclusion The results confirm that access to quality healthcare is a privilege in South Africa, available only to the minority of the population. The study paints a grim picture of household vulnerability in South Africa and underlines the need for a National Health Insurance that would enable universal access to quality healthcare in the country.}

Interest variables were household and community-levels of poverty, while the outcomes were pregnancy and HIV testing and health services seeking. Results showed that in Malawi only household poverty was associated with a higher likelihood of pregnancy, while in South Africa household- and community-levels of poverty were associated with a higher likelihood of pregnancy. In Nigeria, household- and community-levels of poverty were not significantly linked to pregnancy but were associated with a lower likelihood of HIV testing and health seeking behaviour. The study shows empirical evidence of the construction of negative health outcomes in poor households and communities in Nigeria, Malawi, and South Africa. Therefore, if the demographic dividend is to be a reality in the near future, it is imperative to ensure that poverty-alleviation urgently occurs.}

Findings show that the pandemic exacerbated the disproportionate burdens related to gendered roles of household management, childcare, and mobility, both on the macro- as well as the micro-scale. The article thus defines the “gender–poverty–mobility nexus” that shapes space and everyday life in the Gauteng City-Region, precluding places like Denver from overcoming their marginality. Post-pandemic planning policy could be transformative for such spaces if it can build on this knowledge to better identify the needs of these vulnerable social groups and connect them to opportunities. It concludes with suggestions on how these empirically revealed dynamics could be translated into responses on the urban and regional scales, in the name of more equitable, resilient planning futures for Johannesburg and beyond.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Reducing crime is a fundamental goal of all policymakers, because its costs are both pecuniary and non-pecuniary. A number of studies have shown that individuals who are victims of crime report lower levels of life satisfaction or subjective well-being (SWB) as compared to non-victims (Powdthavee, 2005; Cohen, 2008; Davies \& Hinks, 2010). But, what is not as clear is how this nexus may differ based on household geo-type, or put differently, whether a household is located in an urban area versus a rural area. The rationale as to why geographical location is likely to play a role is as follows: (a) people migrate from rural to urban areas in hopes of finding a job or better standard of living. Given that urban migration is associated with ``false expectations`` (Mulcahy \& Kollamparambil, 2016:1357), it may lead some to turn to crime as a means of coping. Therefore, one expects to see more crime in cities as opposed to farm areas. (b) In rural areas, people share a sense of community or 'Ubuntu'. This means that should someone fall victim to crime, others will ensure that its effects on well-being are minimized, by assisting where they can. (c) Social disorganization theory explains differences in urban and rural crime rates, as it suggests that ``a person's residential location is more significant than the person's characteristics when predicting criminal activity`` (Bond, 2015: para 4). This paper investigates the impact of perceived crime on individual well-being in urban and rural areas of South Africa using a nationally representative panel dataset from 2008 to 2017. By making use of a fixed-effect model, a finding was that perceived crime negatively influences the SWB of individuals living in rural and urban areas in South Africa. Unlike the urban coefficient, the rural coefficient is not statistically significant. These results suggest two patterns: firstly, perceived crime plays a stronger role in predicting SWB in urban areas as compared to rural areas. This is likely because urbanization is linked to a higher rate of crime (Park, Burgess \& McKenzie, 1925). Secondly, it provides empirical support that there exists a geographically differentiated relationship between perceived crime and the SWB nexus in South Africa. The estimates are robust to the inclusion of the inequality variable as well as alternative models (specifically random ordered probit model).}

Using the 2017 General Household Survey (GHS) dataset, this study examines the driving factors affecting households’ recycling behaviour and payment for waste disposal in South Africa. The methods of data analysis were based on descriptive statistics and a Bivariate Probit regression model. The descriptive statistics results indicate that there are 56.29\% male-headed and 43.71\% female headed households, with an average age of 49 years. In addition, the study shows that 89.97\% of household heads had formal education with a mean monthly income of 11,099.07 ZAR/650.504 USD. The study also revealed that 22\% of the households sampled had access to social grants. The results from the Bivariate Probit regression model show that household’s income, access to social grants, formal educational attainment and the age of the household were significant (p < 0.01) driving factors affecting households’ recycling behaviour and payment for waste disposal. The study concludes that the households’ socio-economic factors affect their recycling behaviour and willingness to pay for waste management in South Africa. Actions targeted at poverty alleviation and environmental sensitization programmes are key for facilitating environmental conservation behaviours of households in South Africa in order to achieve the environmental sustainability Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of the United Nations.}

From a social development and social policy perspective, this conceptual paper provides a compelling argument about the dividends that accrue from integrating housing and education planning. The rights to housing and education are social investments that promote human, social and economic development. The impact of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) and its subsequent lockdowns were too severe on children from poor households who occupied inadequate housing. The authors make use of a literature methodology that synthesises United Nations policies and updates on COVID-19, empirical research and government policies and steps taken to attenuate the impact of the pandemic. The paper establishes that the country is still impaired by high levels of poverty which locks poor children in poor schools and poor housing. During COVID-19, millions of these children had their rights to education undermined because their economic and housing circumstances could not allow them to participate in online learning. Having established the essential social development potential of housing it is therefore fitting to rethink how social policy could be employed to dovetail the housing and education nexus. The authors recommend research to help envision this relationship, not only from a theoretical level but also from collaborative implementation processes.}

  abstract = {Poverty persists in many countries especially those in the sub-Saharan African region where the levels have been getting worse. The extent of poverty has been worsened in the last 5 years by the many exogenous factors that have gone beyond the control of individual countries. From Covid-19 in late 2019 to early 2020 going all the way to 2021, to Ukraine Russia war that disrupted global supply chains, to the war between Israel and Hamas that have left countries divided. Several countries have also witnessed natural disasters like cyclones and heavy rains and tidal waves that have caused irreparable damage to livelihoods.  In the wake of these external factors over and above country specific a number of governments introduced social grants as safety nets to help households in danger of abject poverty. This study assesses the dynamics of poverty within social grant-dependent households in South Africa, exploring the extent to which social grants mitigate poverty across varying levels of deprivation. Using 2023 data from a representative national survey, the analysis applies conditional probability models to examine the influence of social grants on household poverty risk, considering three distinct poverty thresholds: the Food Poverty Line, the Lower Bound Poverty Line, and the Upper Bound Poverty Line. Findings reveal that households receiving grants experience a statistically significant reduction in poverty risk, particularly at the lower poverty levels, underscoring the effectiveness of grants as a targeted poverty alleviation tool. However, unemployment, single-headed households, and racial disparities are found to compound poverty risk, pointing to the need for an integrated approach that combines social grants with employment and empowerment programs. Female-headed households are especially vulnerable, showing a higher likelihood of poverty across all poverty lines, likely due to factors such as lower income and greater caregiving responsibilities. The study concludes that while social grants play a critical role in reducing poverty risk, additional measures are essential for addressing the underlying socioeconomic disparities that affect poverty dynamics. Recommendations include increasing grant values to match inflation, expanding job creation efforts, and implementing targeted support programs for the most vulnerable demographics, particularly single-parent and female-headed households. These measures would enhance the efficacy of social grants and support long-term poverty reduction efforts in South Africa.   }

However, little is known about the effect of psychological capital on climate change adaptation. There are calls for better empirical models and transdisciplinary approaches to understand the underlying drivers of climate change adaptation in smallholder farming systems. This study draws from behavioural decision research to assess psychological factors influencing climate change adaptation in the uMkhanyakude district of KwaZulu-Natal. This study adopted the Theory of Planned Behaviour to understand the effect of psychological capital on climate change adaptation. Data were collected from a sample of 400 smallholder farmers who were randomly selected from the uMkhanyakude district. Survey data were analysed using a multivariate probit regression model. The results of the multivariate probit regression model indicated that psychological capital (attitudes towards climate change, subjective norms, and trust) played an important role in influencing climate change adaptation. Climate change adaptation is also influenced by the gender of the farmer, education level, household size, and Tropical Livestock Units. These findings underscore the role of psychological capital in shaping climate change adaptation. This study recommends using transdisciplinary approaches (i.e., combining economics and psychology) in evaluating farmers’ responses to climate change.}

These studies use new datasets—including income tax data—and new empirical methods to investigate the drivers of household income and individual earnings inequality in South Africa. Increased returns to experience and an increased rate of return to tertiary qualifications are key drivers of a widening earnings distribution. Tax data merged with survey data show that those at the top of the earnings and income distributions have done well in both absolute and relative terms, thus increasing inequality. Direct taxes and social grants are progressive, indirect taxes are less progressive, and tax exemptions for health insurance and pension fund contributions are regressive. A significant proportion of the current middle class are vulnerable to falling into poverty. Overall, South Africa has not made progress in reducing its extreme inequality over the past decade.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation faces a persistent challenge of poverty with over half of its population classified as multi-dimensionally poor. To address this global concern which is in tandem with SDG 1 (zero poverty), this research was designed to investigate the status of farm household, the determinants of poverty and coping strategies adopted by the affected households in the South Eastern Nigerian. Primary data were randomly collected from 140 farm households in Ideato South Local Government Area of Imo State, South West Nigeria. The cross-sectional data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics, multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and OLS regression models. Four functional forms of the OLS multiple regression models were estimated including the linear, semi-log, double log and exponential models. The best fit model was selected based on standard econometric criteria. The semi-log model was deemed the best model and therefore used for the final analysis. It was found that majority of the household heads are not well educated, thus making education a serious factor in the study area. The mean age of the household heads was 50 years with mean monthly income of about 543.82 US dollars (based on 2014 exchange rate of Nigerian Naira to USD). Empirical results of the multidimensional poverty based on 10 poverty indicators shows that the sampled population is poor with a weighted sum of MPI greater than 30. It was found that sex of household head, primary occupation of the household head, household size and household income were the major determinants of poverty. The major coping strategies adopted to cope with the household poverty are, buying of cheap items and changing consumption patterns to adjust to available income. The study recommends increased promotion of family planning usage, gender inclusive interventions and establishment of tailor-made poverty alleviation programs that address food insecurity and poverty. To boost the income earning capacities of farm households, government and donor agencies are recommended to provide social protection services to farm households. More research is needed on how farmers can access technologies that will help them improve agricultural productivity, promote their chances of participating in agri-preneurship.}

  abstract = {Cabbage is one of the most cultivated vegetable crops that are used as a staple crop because of its affordability and nutritional value. Improving profit efficiency in vegetable farming is important for both economic, livelihood, and to certain extent - food security. The crop plays a significant role in reducing the poverty levels of the previously disadvantaged in different parts of South Africa.  We argue that cabbage is mostly grown by smallholder farmers whose technical efficiency is not well known. It is for this reason that we take measures towards developing empirical evidence on technical efficiency to enhance its production and advancement. The study estimated technical efficiency and factors of technical inefficiency among smallholder irrigation producers of cabbage. A total of 150 growers were selected from a list of vegetable farmers from Eastern Cape Municipalities using a multi-stage sampling. A stochastic production frontier model was employed while correcting for heteroscedasticity in stochastic and inefficiency error terms. Gross margin was used to determine the profitability of smallholder cabbage farming. The study findings revealed that farming is practiced by the elderly who mainly had primary education. There were increasing returns from cabbage farming and farmer average technical efficiency of about 78\%. This implies 21.16\% inefficiency level, indicating that there are reserves available to raise revenues through refining practical and allocative competencies of farmers. Farm size (Area), seed and capital were production-increasing variables while fertilizer and labour used were reducing farm returns of cabbage production. Sources of farmer technical inefficiency were age, farm experience, years spent in school, access to extension services, household size and transportation to markets. The provision of formal skills development training and resources for farmers could improve the technical and managerial capacities of farmers.}

  abstract = {Background The Sustainable Development Goals include commitments to end poverty, and promote education for all, gender equality, the availability of water and decent work for all. An important constraint is the fact that each day, many millions of women and children, and much less frequently men, carry their household’s water home from off-plot sources. The burden of fetching water exacerbates gender inequality by keeping women out of education and paid employment. Despite speculation about the potential health impacts of fetching water, there is very little empirical evidence. We report the first large study of the health impacts of carrying water on women and children. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in South Africa, Ghana and Vietnam during 2012. It investigated water carrying methods and health status. Because areas of self-reported pain were correlated we undertook factor analysis of sites of reported pain, to interpret patterns of pain reporting. Regression analysis using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) investigated water carrying as a risk factor for general health and self-reported pain. Results People who previously carried water had increased relative risk of reporting pain in the hands (risk ratio RR 3.62, 95\% confidence interval CI 1.34 to 9.75) and upper back (RR 2.27, 95\% CI 1.17 to 4.40), as did people who currently carry water (RR hand pain 3.11, 95\% CI 1.34 to 7.23; RR upper back pain 2.16, 95\% CI 1.25 to 3.73). The factor analysis results indicate that factor 1, ‘axial compression’, which is correlated with pain in the head and upper back, chest/ribs, hands, feet and abdomen/stomach, is associated with currently (0.30, 95\% CI 0.17 to 0.43) or previously (0.21, 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.42) carrying water. Factor 2, ‘soft tissue strain’, which is correlated with pain in the neck, shoulders/arms, lower back and hips/pelvis or legs, is marginally negatively associated with currently (-0.18, 95\% CI -0.32 to -0.04) carrying water. The factor ‘axial compression’ was more strongly associated with carrying water containers on the head. Conclusions Participants who reported a history of current or past water carrying more frequently reported pain in locations most likely to be associated with sustained spinal axial compression in the cervical region. Given the fact that cervical spinal conditions are globally one of the more common causes of disability, our findings suggest that water carrying, especially by head loading is a major contributing factor in musculoskeletal disease burden in low income countries. Our findings support the proposed indicator for monitoring SDG6.1: “Percentage of population using safely managed drinking water services at home.”}

Globally, within the last two decades, social protection has helped in transferring about 150 million households out of extreme poverty and food insecurity. However, only about 45\% of the world population is covered by at least one social assistance. This study empirically examines the effect of social protection on food security in the Global South, using West Africa as a case study. Data were sourced from the World Development Indicators and the Country Policy Institutional Assessment for the period 2005–2018. Data cover 15 West African countries that are members of the Economic Community of West African States. To resolve the possible issue of endogeneity, and reverse causality, the study applies the generalised method of moments (GMMs). Result showed that social protection is statistically significant and has a positive effect on food security in West Africa. This implies that a 1\% increase in social protection coverage may increase the level of food security by 2.1\%. Therefore, the study recommends that social protection intervention should be enhanced to mitigate the impact of socioeconomics shocks faced by the poor and the most vulnerable households.}

  abstract = {Farmer–herder conflicts deepen the incidence of poverty and worsen the wellbeing of both farming and herding households in Sub-Saharan Africa. In order to cope with the effects of conflict on their livelihoods, households adopt various adaptation strategies. This paper assesses the effects of adopting conflict adaptation strategies on the multidimensional poverty and subjective wellbeing of farmers and herders using primary data from 500 households (400 farming households and 100 herding households) from two farmer–herder conflict hotspot districts in Ghana. Specifically, the paper analyses the determinants of adopting adaptation strategies, and measures the effect of adopting these strategies on the multidimensional poverty and subjective wellbeing of households using multinomial endogenous switching regression to account for selectivity bias. We found that households’ adoption of adaptation strategies is positively correlated with cattle killing, vulnerability to farmer–herder conflict, household size and labour size, access to land, nearness of farms to cattle grazing routes, access to extension services, and expectations of future occurrence of the conflict. On the other hand, households’ adoption of adaptation strategies is negatively correlated with leisure time, incidences of crop destruction in the past, experience in farming/herding, and membership of farmer-based organisations. We also found that, although the adoption of both on-farm and non-farm adaptation strategies by farming households, and herding and non-herding adaptation strategies by herding households, significantly reduce multidimensional poverty and increase subjective wellbeing. Households’ multidimensional poverty levels are reduced to a greater extent and subjective wellbeing improved if farming households focus on adopting only on-farm adaptation strategies, and herding households focus on adopting only herding adaptation strategies. Hence, interventions aimed at mitigating the effect of farmer–herder conflict on households’ poverty and wellbeing should focus on promoting on-farm and herding adaptation strategies for farming and herding households, respectively.}

Mother–child and co-residents record higher intergenerational persistence compared to father–child and non-coresidents respectively. Further, considering the life-cycle dependency of SWB, the persistence reduces considerably. Lastly, the persistence is no longer found to be positive and significant when correcting for possible endogeneity bias in the SWB association of parents and children.Conclusion: This is the first study on IGM using the measure of SWB and the substantially different findings from other income-based studies points to the value of a more holistic assessment of IGM.Contribution: Further, it is also indicative of the non-income determinants of SWB trends in South Africa.}

However, there is no prediction about how one of the incorporated dimensions—subjective experiences associated with food insecurity—overlaps with poor food consumption. Using data from West Africa, this study illustrates that in 4 out of 10 countries, there is a similar prevalence of food insecurity according to the FIES among segments of the population that are likely undernourished and segments that are likely not undernourished. And in 5 out of 10 countries, there is a relatively large prevalence of food insecurity according to the FIES in the segments of the population that are least likely to be undernourished. Combined, the results offer guidance to policymakers when choosing food-access indicators and illustrate the importance of using the FIES along with other food-access measures.}

While objective class dynamics have received much attention in South Africa, less is known about the subjective social position individuals place themselves. The study aims to make use of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) dataset and assess the relationship between objective and subjective class positions in South Africa. The results show considerable variation between objective and subjective class positions, with a strong middling tendency among all objective class groups in South Africa. The study also shows that this middling tendency has increased in the last decade in South Africa, predominantly due to individuals overestimating their social positions. With a large share of South Africans living close or below the poverty line, there is a clear biasedness of South Africans placing themselves in the middle of society, deviating from their lower objective position. The study further measures the variation between objective and subjective social positions to create a novel class scheme of inflated, deflated, and concordant class perceptions. These biased perceptions are then compared to socio-economic characteristics, showing that gender, race, and education are closely related to bias perceptions in South Africa. Furthermore, the increasing nature of high inequality and social unrest events in South Africa prompts the study also to assess the different social and political attitudes by varying objective and subjective class schemes. The results show that among the subjective class identification, individuals in higher perceived class positions tend to be less angered towards inequality, have lower redistribution preferences, and perceive a weaker conflict between the rich and the poor. These results confirm the impact perceived social positions and biased perceptions could have on social and political attitudes in South Africa. Attitudes that have been considered relevant in voting behavior and social policy formulation models. The results of the paper provides some vital information for policy makers on the dynamics behind subjective class and bias perceptions in South Africa.}

  abstract = {Poverty is a complex subject in traditional African cultures. It is the lack of provision to satisfy the basic human needs of the population. The prosperity gospel as part of Pentecostal Christianity, with origins in the United States of America, presents itself as a new model for poverty eradication. Pentecostal Christianity and the proliferation of Pentecostal churches in Africa, many of whom are adherents of prosperity theology over a period of more than three decades, have not translated to a more prosperous continent, and sub-Saharan Africa is still notably one of the poorest regions of the world. Poverty is a concept with many dimensions that attempts to ascertain the varying degrees of deprivation experienced by populations, individually or collectively. However, certain subjective and sometimes arbitrary interpretations of biblical texts on prosperity as the basis for prosperity theology have encouraged capitalist impulses that often supplant the pursuit of spiritual advantages, leading instead to an increase in crimes including robbery, financial fraud, kidnapping, ritual killings and many other social vices. This article examines the different perspectives of the prosperity gospel, the biblical sources and interpretations used as well as its interpretation of poverty. It shows how prosperity theology, with its own interpretation of poverty, erodes the valuable indigenous resources available to fight poverty within African religious communities, which emphasise community, positive family attachments, social support networks, moral values and accountability, and it examines the implications this has for socio-economic development in Africa.Contribution: This article challenges the theology of prosperity that characterises Pentecostal Christianity and is pervasive in Africa. It contributes to the discourse on how the challenges of poverty require the more community-centred approaches that traditional African values offer as against the self-centredness and greed promoted by the prosperity theology.}

  abstract = {    Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and neighbourhood liveability is dependent on an improved transportation sector. Urban transport is conceptualized as either mobility or accessibility; thus, it remains an integral part in enhancing urban livelihood and serves as a hub connecting all sectors of a city's economy. Lack of access to opportunities and/or services, inadequate transport services, and physical or financial inaccessibility to transport options are prevailing in African cities and have been used to conceptualize transport poverty.        This study seeks the relationship between some dimensions of transport poverty and life satisfaction. The argument put forward in this study is that transport poverty predicts life satisfaction that is a vital aspect of subjective wellbeing.        The study utilise an exploratory, comparative design that will enable the comparison of dimensions of Transport Poverty in Ibadan, Nigeria, and Durban, South Africa. For this study, communities in both Ibadan and Durban were randomly selected; while data were collected through an online survey method. The hypothesis that spatial exclusion mediates the relationship between service availability and satisfaction with life, transport disadvantaged and satisfaction with life, and transport reliability and satisfaction with life were tested through mediation analysis.        For the first hypothesis, partial mediation existed; for the second hypothesis, no mediation existed; for the third hypothesis, total mediation existed. Lastly, spatial exclusion varied between the two countries.        The study concludes that a transport network that is not reliable leads to spatial exclusion, which in turns affects satisfaction with life. Likewise, all dimensions of transport poverty are similar except for spatial exclusion which differs between the countries, with South Africans experiencing more cases of spatial exclusion as compared to Nigerians. }

  abstract = {The presented article is devoted to changes in the scale and qualitative characteristics of objective and subjective poverty in Russian society over the past 20 years. Based on the data of all-Russian empirical studies conducted by the Federal Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2003, 2013 and 2023, the dynamics of the number of objectively and subjectively poor Russians, the areas of intersection of these groups, their living conditions, their perception of their situation and ideas about the future of the country are traced. The obtained results indicate a noticeable reduction in both objective poverty (by income level) and subjective poverty (by self-assessment of their financial situation) among Russians over the past 20 years, which mainly occurred in the first half of this period. The reduction in the shares of objective and subjective poverty was accompanied by their divergence. As a result, an ever smaller share of Russians find themselves in the poverty zone simultaneously in both of these dimensions, and the portraits and characteristics of these groups differ increasingly. The objectively poor differ less in their assessments of their situation and opportunities in various spheres from the population as a whole, which indicates, on the one hand, the relatively shallow nature of income poverty, and on the other, the modest standard of living of the “typical Russian”. The subjectively poor are characterised by more noticeable differences from the population as a whole, in particular, negative assessments of many spheres of their lives. A similar situation is observed with the socio-psychological well-being of representatives of these groups: although over the past 20 years it has improved both among the poor by income and among the poor by self-assessment, positive changes in the first group occurred faster. As a result, the poor by self-assessment are characterised by a higher level of pessimism and anxiety compared to other Russians. In terms of assessments of Russia's development path, both objectively and subjectively the poor differ little from other Russians, demonstrating a public consensus: the population believes in a bright future for the country, but on the condition that it follows a special path that allows for social stability. Finally, it is important to note that the subjectively poor cannot be reduced to pensioners: the data confirm that this group is heterogeneous in its composition, which determines the absence of a clear portrait and the impossibility of identifying it as a \&quot;single addressee\&quot; of socio-economic policy.}

  abstract = {To tackle lasting rural poverty and fully eradicate absolute poverty by 2020, the Chinese government introduced the “targeted poverty alleviation” (TPA) policy in 2013. Quantitative assessments prove the policy's success; yet multidimensional aspects and subjective perceptions of rural poverty are insufficiently accounted for. This study identifies discrepancies between the official eradication of poverty in China and households' subjective perceptions of the remaining dimensions of rural poverty through a qualitative analysis of the voices of rural residents. Drawing on data from focus group interviews in Hebei province, we employ a mixed‐method approach combining computational text mining and diagnostic qualitative data analysis. Identified key dimensions of rural poverty are insufficient income owing to the lack of ample employment opportunities, limited possibilities of income diversification, and the overall lag of rural economic development in the area of investigation; the shortage of supply of social security services, such as health care and pensions; and induced urban migration. Subjective perceptions of poverty entail components of absolute and relative poverty. The potential of the TPA to achieve long‐term and sustainable poverty alleviation is called into question, as structural root causes of rural poverty are insufficiently addressed.}
