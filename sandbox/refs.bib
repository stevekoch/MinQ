abstract = {Abstract The study investigates the potential welfare effect of basic income support (BIS) in reducing poverty and inequality in South Africa. Using the 2017 labour force survey and a benefit incidence analysis, we consider three BIS scenarios: (i) universal income support for those aged between 18 and 59; (ii) only those who are unemployed receive the benefit; and (iii) only unemployed individuals in extremely poor households defined by the food poverty line receive the benefit. Results show that BIS can reduce poverty and inequality. However, the specific effects of the BIS will depend on the targeting scenario considered. The universal BIS is more costly and has higher leakage, with more benefits going to the non-poor. However, this universal support has the biggest overall impact on poverty and inequality reduction because more South Africans receive income support under this scenario. Meanwhile, targeting only the unemployed and the impoverished makes the BIS more pro-poor and progressive, as well as mitigating the leakage of the benefit to the non-poor. This would, however, require that an appropriate targeting mechanism be in place.}

	abstract = {Income inequality and poverty risks receive a lot of attention in public debates and current research. To make income comparable across different types of households, applying the “(modified) OECD scale” – an equivalence scale with fixed weights for each household type – has become a quasi-standard in research. Instead, we derive a base-dependent equivalence scale allowing for scale weights that vary with income, building on micro-data from Germany. Our results suggest that appropriate equivalence scales are much steeper at the lower end of the income distribution than they are for higher income levels. We illustrate our findings by applying them to data on family income differentiated by household types. It turns out that using income-dependent equivalence scales matters for applied research on income inequality, especially if one is concerned with the composition, not just the size of the population at poverty risk.},

abstract = {How much additional income does a family with four children need to attain the same welfare level as a family with two children? And how much does a single person need compared to a childless couple? These questions are important in applied micro-economics and underlie public policy on, for example, social benefits and child allowances. In microeconomics, this is known as the problem of measuring equivalence scales. We estimate these scales using two types of subjective survey information. First, we use answers to survey questions on the income required to attain a given utility level. We compare the results for the usual linear model with semiparametric estimates, in which the functional form of the relationship between required income and family size and actual income is left unspecified. Second, we use answers to the question: how satisfied are you with actual household income? We present parametric and semiparametric estimates for ordered response models explaining this discrete variable. We find that according to the second type of information, costs of children are much larger than according to the first.},

These are important questions for child allowances, social benefits and to assess the cost of children over the life-cycle for example. We discuss equivalence scales in an intertemporal setting with uncertainty. To estimate equivalence scales we use a panel from German households (GSOEP) containing subjective data on satisfaction with life and satisfaction with income to represent the welfare level. Because satisfaction is measured on a discrete scale we use limited dependent variable models for panel data in estimation. Using satisfaction with life data we find that larger households do not need any additional income to be as satisfied as a couple. Using satisfaction with income, however, yields equivalence scales that increase with household size.},

Satisfaction or happiness data have been more frequently used by economists in recent years to analyze individual well-being. The approach differs from other subjective approaches as respondents are requested to evaluate current income rather than income in hypothetical situations. The estimated scale elasticity is higher compared to those from other subjective approaches based on German data. In addition, panel data enable different scale use by the respondents to be controlled. It can be shown that elasticity decreases when unobserved fixed-effects are controlled for.},

abstract = {Abstract We explore a direct approach to estimating household equivalence scales from income satisfaction data. Our method differs from previous approaches to using satisfaction data for this purpose in that it can be used to directly fit and evaluate closed-form and non-parametric equivalence scales of any desired form. Its flexibility makes it easy to consider specific aspects such as income dependence or more specific information on household composition (such as whether household members live in a partner relationship). We estimate and evaluate a number of scales used in the literature. If the equivalence scale is assumed to be independent of income and to depend only on household size, we do not reject the validity of the widely used square-root scale at conventional significance levels. We also test GESE and GAESE restrictions (Donaldson and Pendakur, 2003, 2006) and investigate in detail to what extent household economies of scale depend on income. Our results suggest that the income dependence differs fundamentally across household types (rising economies of scale for ‘family’ households, falling economies of scale for multi-adult households without children and no income dependence for other households).},

abstract = {This paper presents an empirical analysis of the importance of ‘comparison income’ for individual well-being or happiness. In other words, the influence of the income of a reference group on individual well-being is examined. The main novelty is that various hypotheses are tested: the importance of the own income, the relevance of the income of the reference group and of the distance between the own income and the income of the reference group, and most importantly the asymmetry of comparisons, i.e. the comparison income effect differing between rich and poor individuals. The analysis uses a self-reported measure of satisfaction with life as a measure of individual well-being. The data come from a large German panel known as GSOEP. The study concludes that the income of the reference group is about as important as the own income for individual happiness, that individuals are happier the larger their income is in comparison with the income of the reference group, and that for West Germany this comparison effect is asymmetric. This final result supports Dusenberry's idea that comparisons are mostly upwards.}

abstract = {This paper uses the “adult goods” method to estimate the full costs of children. Full costs include both expenditure and time costs. Adult personal time (comprising pure leisure, sleep and other personal care) is used as the adult good. Previous research has shown that the presence of children in the household leads to a reduction in adult personal time. This paper develops a simple economic model of the household to show how this information can be used to develop an equivalence scale for adult consumption that takes account of both the expenditure and time costs of children. Preliminary estimates using Australian data suggest a very large cost—much higher than that typically assumed for expenditure costs. The full cost of children declines with age, despite the expenditure cost rising. The paper discusses the limitations of the adult good method and the assumptions needed to draw welfare conclusions from these and other estimates of child costs.},

 abstract = {This study examines the link between income and living arrangements. Our identification comes from exploiting a discontinuity in age in the benefit formula for the social pension in South Africa. In contrast to previous literature, we find no association between pension income and elderly independence. We do find that potential beneficiaries alter their household structure when they become pension-eligible. Prime working-age women depart, and the presence of children younger than five and young women of childbearing age increase. These shifts in coresidence patterns are consistent with a setting where prime-age women have comparative advantage in work away from extended family relative to younger women. The additional income from old-age support may induce a change in living arrangements to exploit this advantage.},

Potential applications of these results include models of observed heterogeneity in production functions and in consumer demand systems. We then generalize these results to identify a class of collective household consumption models. We extend the existing literature by proving point identification, rather than the weaker generic identification, of all the features of the collective household model, including price effects. We estimate the model using Japanese consumption data, and find substantial variation in resource shares and indifference scales across households of different sizes.}

The approach is similar to that achieved by using, say, Sweave, R and LaTeX, but is written instead in simple Markdown syntax and not tied to any particular output format (e.g., MS Word) nor computational language (e.g., Python). The computational component can be written in C++, Python, SQL, Stan, Bash, or R by way of example. The Markdown script is seamlessly converted to any one of a number of output formats. The output format is essentially an afterthought, and could be rendered as a PDF (LaTeX or Beamer presentation), MS Word, HTML, EPUB, or gitbook document, by way of illustration. Conversion of the Markdown script to the desired output format is performed by pandoc (a universal document converter). These tools can dramatically reduce the amount of time required to complete a research project that can be trivially reproduced. Recent enhancements to RStudio streamline the entire process of output format generation via a simple click of an icon or keystroke shortcut (the minimum requirement is R). Reproducability is guaranteed by using the checkpoint package in R. We also highlight the importance of using version control systems and data sharing/archiving when generating reproducible research.

The estimator is shown to be consistent, asymptotically normally distributed, and to achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte-Carlo evidence indicates that there may be only modest efficiency losses relative to maximum likelihood estimation when the distribution of the disturbances is known, and that the small-sample behavior of the estimator in other cases is good.},

abstract = {Abstract This study estimates food budget share equations to calculate household equivalence scales that incorporate base-independence and address potential endogeneity, even though an instrument that satisfies the usual exclusion restriction may not be available. The application incorporates semi-parametric methods, control functions and heteroscedasticity instrumentation, allowing for heterogeneity in household preferences. The application is founded on the most recent income and expenditure data that are available for South Africa. We find that there is extensive heterogeneity and that endogeneity matters. Failing to account for endogeneity leads to overstated equivalence scales in nearly every circumstance. When we fit our calculated scales to a typical (A+κK)ψ equivalence structure via non-linear least squares, we find values of κ near unity and values of ψ mostly below 0.5. Thus, our analysis suggests that a square-root scale is more appropriate than other scales that have been used to examine poverty and inequality in South Africa.},

Thus, their accuracy is relevant both for budgets and social cohesion; however, their measurement is subject to debate regarding the underlying measure of welfare. Self-assessed insecurities in terms of clothing, housing and food—or basic needs—imply that at least some households are at lower levels of welfare than those that are meeting their needs. We use this to determine the increase in total expenditure required to meet their needs, on average, and thus we are able to calculate the implied equivalence scales. We compare these subjective scales to ones that arise from objective measures, such as expenditure shares on the same items. Our subjective scales are more consistent and plausible across all goods, and are similar to those arising from food expenditure shares. While scales arising from either housing or clothing expenditure shares are neither similar to those arising from food shares or basic needs adequacy nor are they plausible, given the plausibility rules we apply. Furthermore, the subjective equivalence scales are smaller than those proposed in the OECD-modified scale.}

The non-parametric model is found to outperform the parametric model both in and out of sample, while also delivering more plausible estimates of the effect of user fee abolition (i.e. the ‘treatment effect’). In the parametric framework, treatment effects were relatively constant—around 10\%—and that increase was drawn equally from home care and private care. In contrast, in the non-parametric framework treatment effects were largest for large (and poor) families located further from health facilities—approximately 5\%. More plausibly, the positive treatment effect was drawn primarily from home care, suggesting that the policy favoured children living in poorer conditions, as those children received at least some minimum level of professional healthcare after the policy was implemented.},

While there is a strong overall correlation between expenditures and levels of deprivation, the correlation is much weaker among the worst-off South Africans. In addition, the two measures differ considerably in the impact of race, headship, location (urban, rural), and household size on expenditure poverty versus deprivation. In general, the deprivation measure finds more Africans, rural dwellers, members of de facto female-headed households, and members of smaller households deprived than expenditure poor. Only the differences in the effect of household size on poverty are sensitive to assumptions about equivalence scales. As a result, the two measures diverge greatly in identifying the poorest and most deprived sections of the population, which may have considerable consequences for targeting.},

This study decomposed their significance and probabilities in determining the quality of life (QOL) of individuals and households in SSA while controlling for household demographics. The household-level poverty (HLP) index and the indexes for QOL indicators were constructed from the national demographic and health surveys (DHS) for SSA countries. Data on consumption poverty thresholds and income inequality are from the global consumption and income project (GCIP) over 1985–2015. Findings reveal that, while the HLP index elicits more rural poverty across regions, consumption poverty thresholds are more urbanized and persistent across regions, except for Central Africa. The results for income inequality were found to be Gini −0.4396 and Atkinson index −0.4437, and more urbanized across regions. Furthermore, we found that SSA has made giant strides towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) 6 and 3 but no information on the quality of healthcare. However, abysmal likelihoods exist for SDGs 4, 7 and 8 in SSA. Similarly, abysmal probabilities were also found for households’ access to adequate housing, a good environment and insurance coverage. Indeed, SDG-4 is more significant for achieving SDG-8. HLP stand as a significant bottleneck to achieving SDG-7 and adequate housing, while income inequality mars SDG-3 targets and sustainable environmental conditions in SSA. Policy options are discussed.},

In this paper, using a new household survey from South Africa, we are able to derive subjective measures of relative standing, as information is collected on individuals’ perceptions of where they rank in the income distribution. We find considerable differences between objective and subjective measures of an individual’s relative ranking. Furthermore, our results suggest that an individual’s perceived relative status has a significantly larger effect on subjective well-being than objective measures of relative status based on reported income. We also examine the effects on subjective well-being of how individuals perceive their relative position in the income distribution to have changed since childhood, and what they expect their relative position to be in the future. We find that future upward mobility has a smaller effect than upward mobility compared to one’s past, suggesting that life satisfaction is influenced more by what has been achieved than by anticipated achievements.}

    abstract = { AbstractThis paper estimates the causal impact of income on life satisfaction for a broad sample of individuals in a developing country. Using a large and representative panel survey of South African residents, we find that receipt of the Older Person’s Grant—a means-tested cash transfer that is given to residents age 60 and older regardless of labor force status—increases several household-level measures of economic well-being, resulting in a large and significant increase in subjective well-being. Specifically, the average 20\% increase in per capita household income due to this grant increases life satisfaction by approximately 0.2 points, a large effect that extends to all members of the household. The discontinuity in the eligibility of the Older Person’s Grant provides a reliable causal estimate of the effect of income on life satisfaction that is larger than ordinary least squares estimates. }
